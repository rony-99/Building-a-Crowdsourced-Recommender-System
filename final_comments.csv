Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"(1, 3)",4.3,Thank you for sharing this Chris - Black with a brown head - Dark malt aroma with wood barrel aroma - Dark malt body with coffee flavours and good wood barrel flavours as well - Dark malt coffee and wood barrel flavours goes into the finish - This was real good
Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"(1, 4)",4.7,"Boxed beer at home, proper glassware. Pitch black, oily thick pour with a brown head that quickly disappears. Maple upfront alongside roasted coffee, bourbon in the nose. Taste is beautifully layered coffee, chocolate brownie, lots of bourbon barrel character, lots of burnt caramel - with the most balanced balance there is. Big bodied, oily rich mouthfeel, medium carbonation.
Truly one of a kind beer, brewed to perfection."

Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"(1, 7)",5,"There are not hundreds of beers on my bucketlist anymore, throughout the years I have had the pleasure of tasting many of the world's great beers and I am grateful for each and every one of them, but if there is one beer I have been eager to sip for nearly a decade now, it must be this one: Toppling Goliath's Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout, or KBBS as it is sometimes abbreviated.  A coffee stout aged for over a year in bourbon barrels, it was first released in 2012, but the story goes that at that time, only six people showed up - after which founder Carl Lewey stopped selling it and kept the rest of the batch for private consumption.  I guess he must have known already back then that he was onto something, as the buzz around this beer began to grow and it quickly became one of those modern whales every beer lover in the world wants to taste at least once.  In 2015, KBBS reached number one in the list of top beers on this very website, stoking the hype even further; nine years later, it still holds that same enviable position, as it does on BeerAdvocate (as well as second place - though only recently - on Untappd and Brewver).  It goes without saying that I am very happy to be able to finally taste it today on my birthday, from a 2022 vintage bottle (numbered 1679) just over a year old - and of course I know that a beer like this will probably only improve in coming years, but I just could not resist having it in my collection any longer...  Builds up a light brown, mocha ice-coloured, minute-bubbled and therefore densely creamy head of medium thickness, slowly receding and opening yet retaining well around the edge, with some dots of lacing here and there, over a pitch black beer.  The bouquet is intense - and indeed overwhelmingly beautiful, one sniff already managed to convince me instantly of the whole hype around it: top quality Swiss chocolate, chocolate ganache, top class real maple syrup, the finest Colombian coffee, warm bourbon of some high-end brand, vanillin-breathing oak wood and a lot of it (I love it), homemade coffee brownies, Alicante nougat, armagnac, fudge, expensive Belgian chocolates, crème au caramel, artisanal mocha ice cream, coffee liqueur, more dark bitter chocolate underneath and then all kinds of subtle hints ticking all the boxes of a high-level U.S. style 'impy' varying between almond, roasted pecan nuts, cinnamon, fresh bayleaf, pipe tobacco, fresh fig and even more fruitiness warming up (blackcurrant) but then making room again for wet leather, walnut oil, charcoal briefly showing up only to vanish again in seconds, haemoglobin, rum-soaked raisins, date jam, a very vague minerally touch (clay) - before all that dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon and oak return, all intertwined into one monolithic, perfectly aligned and beguiling 'block' of aroma.  In the mouth, the most noble and refined sweetness unfolds, date jam, candied cherries, golden raisins - in a very dense, concentrated manner, with very slight sourish and umami notes here and there, but too subtle to describe; mouthfeel and carbonation are absolutely perfect for this style of beer, rich, velvety, viscously thick yet still oily-smooth, heavily yet supply gliding down the tongue, leaving behind thick layers of fine dark chocolate, toffee, nougat, almond and hazelnut paste, with both the coffee and roasted malts providing bitterness balancing out the sweetness.  An overall bittersweetness fills the mouth in a most complex way, releasing accents of amaretto, bayleaf, cinnamon, light sweet pipe tobacco and, much lighter still, even 'blood' or the juice oozing out of a medium rare steak - all of which matches perfectly without even the slightest sign of a false note, and all of which is enveloped in a noble oaky woodiness (think vanilla and actual wood flavours) and, of course, a long, warming, soothing bourbon bittersweetness, bourbon of high quality in this case, with armagnac- and walnut liqueur-like features.  The finish goes on and on, warming on a cold January night, but more importantly, providing an extended enjoyment of this formidable brew which seems to last forever.  Hops are present 'behind the scenes', with spicy and even very faintly citrus peel-ish details that all contribute to the vast and massive landscape of flavours.  The coffee returns every now and then retronasally, in a most sophisticated way.  This is one to enjoy very slowly and over a very long period of time: as the temperatures shift, one shade of beauty is replaced by another.  This is the one beer I spent the most money on in my twenty-five years of tasting beer in a serious way, but I have no regrets - on the contrary, I am filled with joy and gratitude that after such a long time, this most coveted of the world's craft beers (or one of the most coveted at least) finally reached me.  The number of bottles released each year seems to have grown in past iterations, probably since Toppling Goliath extended their production capacity with a new brewing installment in 2018, so who knows, maybe one day this gem will become a bit more widely available, and when that happens, I will be happy to pay for a second one.  As for now, I suppose I could consider selling the empty bottle, as I noticed one being auctioned in the States for no less than a hundred dollars...  Anyway, to conclude this long journey through this awe-inspiring brew: I think scoring becomes a bit meaningless in the light of not only this beer's inherent perfection and majestic beauty, but also in its consistent high scores in the decade in which it has been in existence.  Additionally, I cannot find anything I do not like here, not even after examining it with a microscope, so to speak, so here you go: the perfect score, mostly symbolically because American style imperial stout really does not get much better than this, at least not in what I have tasted so far."

The flavor has dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, oak and coconut, vanilla, booze and alcohol and some raisin. Everlasting finish. Sure delicious, not easy to drink, but very, very, very nice. 230311"
Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"(1, 14)",4.3,"12 oz bottle. Pours nearly pitch black color and capped by a small tan layer of foam that settles in quickly to a thin film and leaves some nice legging on the glass. The aroma shows notes of rich, dark chocolate, maple syrup, and roasted coffee over a dark roasted malt base with further notes of bourbon and oak laden vanilla. The maple syrup is dominant but the underlying chocolate, coffee, and oaky vanilla shines as it warms up. The flavor follows suit with the dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and maple syrup right up front along with the bourbon oak, vanilla, and a moderate bitterness for balance on the back end. The maple syrup is sweet but tastes like quality grade A stuff compared to fake adjuncts found in other similar beers. Full bodied and slick with moderate carbonation that leads to a bitter sweet dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and bourbon oak on the finish with lingering maple syrup sweetness after each sip. This is really tasty and definitely one of the better maple stouts I’ve had for sure, but not sure it quite lives up to the hype or the price to get it. Still a great beer."

Mycket samma i smaken som i doften. Snygg och mjuk kaffeton, mocca, lönnsirap, choklad, hasselnöt, nötkräm. Ruskigt fint integrerad fatkaraktär, men egentligen inte jättemycket smak från whiskeyn. Väldigt snäll eldighet på sin höjd. Väl avvägt, elegant trots kraftpaket. Görs helt klart öl som är större och maffigare, men här balanseras det med elegans. Finns oerhört lite att klaga på. Skulle jag få önska något så skulle det vara något mer fatkaraktär, lite mer smak och eldighet från whiskeyn. Oerhörd kul val att bocka av från listan."

Oh yeah... looks like syrup, dark chocolate brown with basically no head but tons of thick, syrupy legs.  Flavor has the booze, cognac and dark whiskey, chocolate, coffee and coffee liqueur, the maple is more complimentary than anything.  Finishes a bit hot, but really smooth given everything happening."

Pours jet black with a small dark brown head, as drowland said it was smaller than expected but we also didn't pour it super hard. Aroma has a ton of maple of coffee right away with vanilla and oak as well. The flavor has a strong coffee front end with the maple and sweetness of the vanilla in the finish. Had this side by side with MD and we actually preferred that over KBBS, but this is still stupid good. Honestly, if Bourbon County releases a Maple variant it would be somewhat close to this.

Using this as my honorary 10,000th rating even though I've since passed 10k with my backlog. Oh well. Yeah, we bought a $100 beer and each of our pours were $25 each, but hey, it's family and the top beer of the moment, so why the hell not? We had side by side with 2018 Mornin' Delight and I think actually liked that a bit more. Jet black pour with a small tan head that fades to a ring. I honestly think there'd be a better head, but I had to carefully split the bottle into four pours. As soon as I cut through the inch of wax and cracked the cap, I was hit with a punch of maple and coffee. After the pour, the aroma shows fudgey bourbon, vanilla, oak, maple, coffee, rich fudge, touches of dark fruits. Rich flavor, on the sweet side, super smooth, bourbon, vanilla, oak, coffee, maple.

This is really something else. It's got a thick mouthfeel that coats the inside of your mouth but still somehow manages to not be oily, a hint of coffee, a big, bold blast of make syrup that adds a bit of sweetness and a lot of complexity, and a gigantic bourbon flavor that makes you think you've gotten to the stage of alcoholism that you are hiding booze in your coffee at work.

Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"(1, 59)",4.8,"2016. Silver Wax. Bottle 332. So intense! Aroma: Tons of sweet bourbon, maple syrup (more and more after warming up), good choco, molasses, vanilla, a bit walnuts. Perfect. Taste: The same + sour coffee and dark fruits. 4.75/5

// Aromat nieziemski, piorunująco intensywny. Mnóstwo słodkiego bourbonu, syrop klonowy (po czasie coraz bardziej wyczuwalny), melasa, wysokiej jakości czekolada, beczkowa wanilia, z czasem doszły jeszcze włoskie orzechy. Nie wąchałem nic, co by tak doskonale pachniało. Przez pierwsze pół godziny wziąłem tylko jednego łyka, a resztę czasu tylko niuchałem to cudo. Ocena 5/5 to mało.
Pierwszy łyk i wow, gęste w kurwę. W zasadzie powtórka tego, co w zapachu + dochodzi jeszcze kwaskowata kawa i ciemno-czerwone owoce. Alkohol po ogrzaniu się skromnie pojawia, ale jest maksymalnie szlachetny, taki typowo od beczki.
Za smak daję 4.75 i to głównie za kompleksowość. Subiektywnie może nawet ""tylko"" 4.50 (nie przepadam za kwaśną kawą) - dosyć mocno przypominał mi niektóre kawowe RIS-y z Cycle - główna różnica, to lepiej ułożony alkohol.
Ten aromat długo będzie za mną chodził po nocach."

Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"(1, 70)",5,"From notes. Enjoyed this as part of the long-anticipated Toppling Goliath Brouhaha with Travis, Chris, Doug, and Ryan at Travis’s house on September 24. Gold-waxed, 2014 vintage, 12 oz bottle shared by me. The pour is a thick and heavy dark black with a thin ring of dark mocha colored head that leaves no trace. This thing just sticks to the glass. It’s amazing. The aroma is unbelievable. The balance of heavy maple, chocolate, vanilla fudge, molasses, coffee, dark fruits, molasses, and brown sugar is just amazing. The bourbon barrel adds a wonderful oaky complexity and a hint of bourbon that really ties all of this together. The flavor is equally as amazing. The chocolate and vanilla fudge right up front are spectacular, and the maple comes rolling in with the dark fruits, sweet molasses, coffee, and brown sugar. The bourbon holds off, but remains detectable in each aspect. The balance is great. The mouth feel is unlike anything I’ve had. Period. This is so thick and viscous, you think you might actually be drinking syrup. The carbonation is soft and velvety with a lingeringly maple, coffee, chocolate/vanilla fudgey, light bourbon bounty of liquid sex. Jesus H. This is everything a beer should be."

Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"(1, 73)",4.6,"Bottle from mid-2013, drank early 2016. The aroma can be smelled across the room: maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, buttery oak, coconut, butterscotch, a little black licorice. Very sugary, very rich, very deep. Legs for days--a swirl makes the liquid stick to the sides of the glass. Flavor is incredibly rich and sweet: sticky vanilla bean, chocolate covered cherries, plums, fruity coffee beans. Mildly bitter toasty oak mid-palate, along with graham cracker. Dark chocolate swoops in and coats the tongue at the swallow. Finishes quite tangy and fruity, though heavy roast settles in long after. Creamy, sugary, syrupy, thick. I keep coming back to what one of the guys I shared this bottle with said: ""I think I just saw the face of God."""
Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"(1, 74)",5,"Kbbs ’14

Pours a viscous, motor oil black color, with a small dark brown head, soon collapsing to a tiny ring of lacing with some spider web in the middle of the glass. Leaves back a mix of tiny tubbles and an oily texture after swirling.

Although I opened this after more than a year of its release, the coffee is as dominant as it has been in fresh Mornin’ Delight. In this though, the Bourbon adds to the complexity of the coffee, creating an unforseen richness of aromas on the nose, while maple syrup appears to be a bit muted. There is a luscious bakers chocolate quality in this, tying the oaken barrel and flowery, cold pressed coffee beautifully together, creating a spicy coffee bean decadence, amped up by a mix of molasses and syrup. Coffee itself has an earthen note to it, perfectly enhanced by the barrel, while vanilla blends into scorched malts, producing an intense, wood accompanied, spicy praline impression.

I cannot belive the mouthfeel on this is real. This is unbelievable smooth. Rich and creamy, while featuring one of the most intense tasting beers I’ve ever had. Its silkness remains throughout, soothing the warmer parts of the beer with whipped cream and just an unbelievable softness.

Tastes of fudge, earth and brownie batter right from the beginning, together with a sweet and bitter cold pressed coffee appearance, adding foremost a roasty quality to the taste. While the flavors evolve rapidly on the palate, its silk creaminess calmes the upcoming flavor onslaught, leaving everything enjoyable and detectable. Milk chocolate and cocoa nibs set on top of the outstanding creaminess, finding their counterpart in roasty malts and a genuine coffee bitterness, blending into earth. Has a hot peak, together with a flowery barrel dryness, while licorice and a rich chocolate coating, calm the well accentuated, spicy heat. Finishes surprisingly clean and soft, right after the short, burning glimpse, whipped cream works its magic, ensuring the beers world class mouthfeel, while complimenting its chocolate richness. Coates the tongue during the aftertaste, together with gently spiced vanilla and coconut bark, packing also a lingering dryness.

This beer is beautiful throughout, it is indeed perfect. What I loved most about Mornin’ Delight was its outstanding mouthfeel, but this one puts it to shame, by revealing a chewy smoothness, I have never experienced before in a beer. Its taste features a certain ambivalence, on the one hand it drinks fairly easy, due to its unreal silkness, while on the other hand it packs an unbelievable flavor range with a perfectly nuanced intensity to it. Everything seems to be in perfect balance, while maple syrup gets partially replaced by the far more complex Bourbon barrel in comparison to the MD. I understand this beer is highly sought after, this time it is most certainly well deserved."

The bourbon does take over, though. Bourbon taste is sharp. Coffee comes out here. Dark chocolate. Maple comes out in the back. Sweetness lingers. Bourbon flavor lingers also. Very thick. Boozy. Sweet with medium carbonation. Tough to argue which is better, this or Mornin’ Delight, but bourbon always wins."

The nose is more smokey than I anticipated and also features sweet and boozy bourbon, medium coffee, decadent chocolate, toffee, light cinnamon, very roasted barley, and the briefest spicy touch of charred adobo. It’s flat black in color with a dark tan ring head. Wow, smooth doesn’t begin to describe the taste. Chocolate is the primary flavor and is accompanied by velvety bourbon, dry cinnamon with a slightly woody finish. The rich syrup lends only sweetness at first without any distinct maple taste, but it increases greatly as the beer warms to eventually become the dominant flavor. The body is a tiny thin for an imperial stout. It’s a beautiful beer, but I wouldn’t consider it the best barrel-aged stout I’ve tried."

Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"(1, 92)",4.3,"Bottle (12 oz). 2014 vintage. From Brian, thanks! Split 4-ways.



Appearance: Pitch black with a small very dark brown head, little lacing and some legs. 



Aroma: There’s a burst of coffee at first followed by a really fruity presence and rich caramel/toffee. There’s also some spices/cinnamon, bourbon, vanilla, brandy (might just be the fruits though) and fudge. 



Taste: Quite sweet, but well balanced by the coffee acidity. Rich caramel/toffee presence, lots of coffee here too, quite fruity, bourbon, mild spices/cinnamon presence and fudge.



Palate: Full body. Medium carbonation. Thick and silky mouthfeel. Lingering caramel, coffee and fruity finish. Nice alcohol warmth. 



Overall: Excellent barrel-aged RIS. The malt depth is impressive and it’s extremely flavorful and tasty which I guess helps to get some very high ratings from small pours. I liked it a lot, but I didn’t enjoyed it nearly as much as GI Rare (which stunned me when I had it 2 years ago) or Double Black on tap (which was as tasty and more drinkable - yeah no kidding - despite being listed as more than twice the abv of this one)."

The taste is rich and nectar sweet where smooth slick residual sugar intermingle with oily rich dark roasted coffee notes and big velvety chocolate goodness. Wow! It quickly picks up supporting notes of thin slippery sweet smooth bourbon mixed with marshmallow and vanilla. Wow.

Black with no head. Unbelievably fresh and full bodied coffee combined with freshly roasted and ground beans (which was surprising but apparently it was kept at a constant 39 for the last year or so which makes me think I need to get a fridge for certain beers), thick without being overwhelming, chewy, vanilla, light cracked pepper notes that develop on the finish as it dries out and coats the palate. The oak and booze are present but perfectly compliment everything and combine to form an incredible beer that is probably the best stout I have had."

Still pretty good though."

Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"(2, 31)",4.8,"Bottle 9/300. Pours like a thick, spent motor oil. Medium to low carbonation. Little to no head, more like some tan bubbles of carbonation settling on top of the oily splotches. The aromas are insane!! Coffee for days and days. Wow. Smells like freshly ground beans. The dark chocolates give off hints of oak/bourbon, but not much. Coffee dominates this nose. The taste (finally!) has the loads of coffee that you would expect, but digs deep to give you plenty of character. Bakers chocolates graham cracker, charred marshmallow....taste like s’mores! Seriously. Again, wow. The body on this bad-boy is so chewy, you could stand a spoon up in it! Flavors last for an eternity. The sticky mouthfeel lets more flavor cling to your palate....maple syrup...oak...vanilla...and an ever so slight presence of bourbon. Very well hidden. The finish is very warming. Gave me chills after the first sip!! I knew this beer would be special, but wasn’t sure that it would live up to the hype. It did...and then some! Was close to giving this a perfect 5, but couldn’t quite say that it was the best in appearance. Other than that, second to none."

This is one of those beers that came along in 2013, was super-hyped, and delivered. I easily finished half of the bottle and shared the rest and was still left wanting more. Very rich & decadent but very smooth and easy to drink for such a huge beer."

Aroma is more subdued compared to Mornin’ Delight. mildly sweet, vanilla, bourbon-soaked oak, maple syrup, espresso, dark chocolate, toasted marshmallow, sticky caramel, and pancake batter. Sweeter in taste with greater emphasis on the maple syrup, caramel, and pancake batter. Extremely slick, just coats the inside of your mouth. Smooth, creamy, and full-bodied without being overly heavy. As with Mornin’ Delight, the slight ’twang’ in the finish prevents it from a perfect score. Such an amazing blend of aromas and tastes."

poured thick as synthetic pancake syrup, but darker. creamy khaki head. the nose on this is really impressive, if overwhelming: hot pancakes drenched with loads and loads of maple syrup. soft/woody bourbon undertones, bitter dark chocolate, and almost too-sweet syrup flavor dominate the taste buds. full bodied, thick and sticky with a long finish.

this is a delicious beer but it was difficult for me to just finish one 12oz bottle. it isn’t as life-changing as many of the reviews lead you to believe, though. except for the possibility that it will give you diabetes."

Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"(2, 49)",4.7,"Bottle 230/300 poured into snifter after having 15 minutes on the counter to warm from the fridge. 

A- Pours a viscous pitch black with a dark brown/mocha head about 1/4 inch high with insane retention for a stout. Detectable carbonation bubbles, but on the low side, as appropriate for style. Over two minutes, the head fades to a mocha ring around the edges of the glass. 

S- Mother of god- this smells like Vermont maple syrup aged in a bourbon barrel, dipped in chocolate, and wrapped with the tears of angels. Honestly though, the syrup sweetness with the wood notes really dominate, although the bourbon notes are just hanging out behind them. 

T- Maybe I am just riding the hype train, but this tastes absolutely amazing. A huge sweet maple sugar (think the little maple butter candies you can buy up in Vermont) followed by a super mellow bourbon barrel character mixed in with chocolate, caramel, and a balancing roast and bitter note. 

M- Thick. A bit more carbonation than I expected for this, but it works well with the beer. This is an oil slick of a beer, as it should be for the style. This is definitely a sipper, but I could (and will) drink a full 12 ounces in one sitting happily. 

O- This is by far the best tasting and smelling beer I have ever experienced. Insanely good, better than BAVDL and BCBS rare in my opinion. I am actually a bit upset I decided to open this bottle, because I don’t know if I will ever get it again. I guess I will be at the release if they release it in the future!"

Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"(2, 51)",4.7,"9/7/13Huge thanks to my buddy Matt for sharing this awesome bottle. Aroma pancakes breakfast. Not maple, maple plus pancakes, maybe some cinnamon. The mouthfeel is perfect balance between thickness and carbonation. Taste has the perfect amount of bourbon but was not in the aroma. Bit of maple and chocolate. And coffee, but the coffee was really in the back or rather perfectly mixed. I really like coffee bombs, I guess it could have used more coffee in this but that might have thrown it off. Because everything really is perfectly balanced. No burn at all. Tried this at an amazing tasting up against some of my favorite ba stouts and this was the best. We opened BC Coffee (my previous #1) right after this and it didn’t even come close.  Even later in night trying Rare and Murda’d Out, this still stood out as the best.  Fuck man, amazing.



2014 vintage, on 10/18 at the Malloy tasting, thanks steve, reminded again if how good this is. More maple than I remember. Ton of coffee, not much bourbon, maybe just covered by the intense coffee and maple. Either way amazing. This and vanilla darklord are my top 2. And I’m not sure if I could settle that debate without a best of 7 head to head.



11/22/14 13v14. Still amazing as it gets. Intense coffee, maple and bourbon. 14 is a little more sweeter and just has all around bolder flavors. I thought it was better fresh, although it was a split decision between the group.  Not much drop off on it."

S- reminiscent of Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - just a little better. Whiskey, rich vanilla, molasses and toffee persist. A hint of grains, chocolate covered raisins, graham crackers, marshmallows, caramelized sugar, wood and sugar cookie batter. M- light carbonation supports a full body and a smooth, oily full palate. T- tangy cacao, coffee, burning alcohol and vanilla get you going up front. More sugary maple syrup, dried fruits, marshmallows, fudge, mocha and molasses form a sweet and solid middle. Some tangy hints of overripe apples and bing cherries. Whiskey persists throughout. Walnuts, grains, dry grass bitterness form towards the end. Ending is long and sweet with a rich chocolate, maple, toffee and cake. Is this Heaven? No, it's a beer from Iowa."

Pours black with a small head, but one that is fairly well retained and leaves lots of lace that oozes down the glass with the weight of the legs.



The aroma is big, lots of coffee & fudge, a little bit of bell pepper, but honestly not in a bad way at all. Plenty of dark chocolate, some nice rich vanillin forward bourbon. 



The flavor is again huge and rich... The coffee is really well done here bringing a nice big roasty character with a mild bitterness. There are some really nice sweeter flavors of raisin, fudge, & maple but it’s got some nice dark bitter chocolate as well. The vanilla and oaky elements from the bourbon are well presented.

Pours a deep brown, not quite opaque, with amber edges and a tiny dark tan head that settles quickly into a ring. The barrel notes blast immediately from the aroma- vanilla, brown sugar, whiskey, coffee, maple syrup, caramel, and oak. Layers and layers of sweetness and roast. Same can be said for the flavor, with maple syrup, coffee, brown sugar, vanilla, oak, roasted malts, and cocoa beans. Medium-bodied - thinner than Mornin’ Delight for sure - with modest carbonation and a warm, sweet, roasty mouthfeel. The sweetness isn’t overwhelming here, nor are any other notes. They’re all big but don’t push one another out of the way or offend the palate. Man, this is good. I put it even with Mornin’ Delight because I like the bigger body there and extra splash of complexity with the barrel here. Lives up to its billing."
Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"(2, 65)",4.5,"Very black with very brown head, initially creamy but disappears after a couple of minutes leaving a ring of foam around the circumference of the grads.

Reminds me of Morning Delight with muted maple tones and the bitterness almost completely deleted. Well, there is a little bit in the far finish. A fantastic beer but i think many would call this a dessert beer so your mileage may vary."

Light bitterness at the end. No astringence. Full body, ultra creamy mouthfeel. This is the real shit! At this level of sweetness its really a dessert beer, but oh what a dessert beer. The only real points docked are due to the sweetness which becomes a bit cloying after a while."

An even more impressive taste, full of butterscotch, coffee, and smooth roast. Some maple. and vanilla bourbon. So decadent. Surprisingly drinkable given the richness of the flavors.

Throw that in a barrel however, and something magical happens.

Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"(2, 78)",5,"As soon as I cracked this cap, the room was filled with luscious bourbon, roasted malts; caramel; and impressively pungent, high end coffee. Jesus, this smells amazing. 



Taste follows suit: roasty initially before bourbon and coffee interrupt everything and take center stage. Impeccably rounded overall profile. Rivals the very best stouts I’ve ever tasted. World class status is merely implied after the first sip. 



And Kentucky Brunch’s body coats the mouth unlike almost anything else I’ve tasted. The Peg’s stouts are its only peers in this category. 



Holy moly, this is better than Mornin’ Delight... and that isn’t said lightly. Toppling Goliath killed it. Again.  



Update: So it’s been a week, and I’ve decided to upgrade my rating to a perfect 5.  I previously gave it 4/5 on appearance (which is incorrect upon looking at my picture of it afterwards; was trying to be overly picky at the time) and 19/20 for a total of 4.8.  However, I’ve been thinking about this nonstop for the last week and feel comfortable saying that KBBS is a perfect beer.  It’s arguably the best brew I’ve ever smelled, tasted, and enjoyed on the palate, and that makes it a 5.  Hats off to the TG guys: Kentucky Brunch truly is a masterpiece."

It’s cold, so some warmth should open this up more. Initial is thick and sweet, touches of maple, oak, and cocoa. Sticky caramel, dark roast is mellow grows as it warms. The coffee comes out a bit more roast, a good intensity up front as it trails off, firm presence in the middle. Sticky and firmly flavored, roasty with good vanilla, barrel flavor as we round the corner. Vanilla, coffee, sticky caramel. Toffee, espresso, and richer coffee as we round up, a bit more roasty, sticky, barrel flavor. The base is still thick and firm, not making this pick up much if any heat from the barrel. Oak, roasty, and coffee. I think this is much more drinkable than the Mornin’ Delight. It’s sweet, but not nearly as much. Thick and full, but not overwhelming. The coffee element comes on at just the right time. Really well put together. I prefer this to Mornin, which may just be sensory overload. This one is the gem. Finish is luscious espresso, oak and chewy sweetness, roast. Really nice experience. Damn impressive."
Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch,"(2, 81)",4.7,"Tap at TG.  Incredibly rich aroma - tons of fresh coffee, like stuffing your nose in a bag of freshly roasted, oily beans.  Lots of chocolate, some caramel, a touch of dark fruits, roasty,  slight alcohol note.  The barrel notes are a bit subtle to me, but add a slight whiskey character and some complexity.  Pours jet black, opaque, thin brown head lingers for a minute, slight lacing.  Flavor follows the nose - massive dose of espresso, lots of rich chocolate, nice roast character, bitterness helps balance the big malt profile but is not aggressive.  Alcohol is pleasantly warming and generally well hidden, again some complexity and whiskey notes from the barrel.  Fairly sweet brew but not cloying, moderately bitter, fairly sweet/rich finish.  Very full body, chewy, velvety texture, low-medium carbonation.  Killer brew, absolutely fantastic."

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(1, 8)",4.8,"Here we are then: the barrel aged version of one of Sweden's most coveted beers, the honey-flavoured Stormaktsporter by family brewery Närke, the fame of which is due in large part to this very website - as is the fame of this Kaggen version, coming in second on the list of the ""best beers of the world"" (and holding a similar position on both Untappd and Brewver).  Needless to say, I just had to taste this one when I unexpectedly got the opportunity, as the 2019 vintage (one of several since the first one appeared in 2005) has, since this year only, been sold through a selection of specialist shops in several countries including the Netherlands and Denmark.  No doubt the 'whale' value of this legendary beer has waned a bit due to this very fact - several online shops still stock it today and ship internationally - but it remains one of those bucket list beers I have been dreaming of for years, and now a bottle finally reached my tasting table.  Medium thick, dense and creamy, lightly membrane-like lacing, greyish beige, stable head very slowly breaking over an opaque black robe - showing a burgundy red hue only at the very end.  Dense and initially somewhat 'closed' aroma, gradually unfolding an array of beguiling scents: cocoa nibs and high quality dark chocolate, pronounced oak wood (still including a vanillin touch), molasses, whisky, ground walnuts, cold espresso, dried prunes, roasted almonds, aquavit, freshly crushed black peppercorns, dry caramel, warm brown bread (crust), fudge, dried figs, dark brown honey, dried heather, some light notes of reduced beef stock, bayleaf, clay, cinnamon rolls, burnt blackcurrants, old ebony wood, Japanese soy sauce, dried beech leaves, wet leather and salmiak.  Dense onset with a perfectly tuned, i.e. somewhat restrained and 'noble' sweetness (dried fig, dried blueberry or blackberry, touch ripe blue plum) with a faint hint of beef stock- or gravy-like umami surrounding it, softly carbonated with immediately thick, heavily oily, 'viscous' mouthfeel.  Thick malt slabs of dark chocolate, black cocoa, brown bread, fudge and cold black coffee ensue, piled on top of each other but working as one compact bittersweet whole filling the entire mouth cavity - as any decent imperial stout or imperial porter should, of course.  The subdued sweet dark fruit and umami beef stock accents travel along this huge dark maltiness, which increases in bitterness as the roasted effects build up and a robust amount of peppery hops, well hidden under all that dark maltiness but adding considerable bitterness 'behind the scenes', starts to set in; dryness is achieved by a pronounced woodiness (bringing back those wonderfully noble oak aromas retronasally) but also by the booze, which was noticeable early on already and grows in the end - with whisky- and gin-like effects.  The alcohol puts up a fight against that massive malt bittersweetness and almost wins, but things get balanced again in the finish and aftertaste, where this alcohol warmth and spiciness makes the malt bittersweetness glow up in the dark rather than brutally scorching it, as it sometimes does in conceptually similar beers.  Glimpses of praliné, bayleaf, liquorice and marmite subtly and briefly pop up in the aftertaste.  This is indeed high nobility, a beer to contemplate in serenity and in earnest, and even though the booziness is perhaps just a tad too strong for me (I really must find the basic Stormaktsporter one day) even after three years of maturing in the bottle, there is no doubt that this brew fully deserves its near-mythical status, with an old-fashioned roasty bitterness, perfect mouthfeel for its style, utterly solid structure and density of flavours.  The perfect accompaniment to a chilly evening in late December and with whales like this, I cannot but give a 'symbolic' score of near perfection.  Another one off the bucket list, and worth every penny."

Piana: Ciemnokremowa, nietrwała, złożona z drobnych oczek. Początkowy, wąski pasek piany szybko zniknął z pola widzenia. Zero zdobień szkła.

Zapach: Aromat jest śliczny, ale stonowany. Nie jest sztuczny i przesadzony w żadną stronę.
Czuć od groma ciemnych owoców, karmel, śliwki, czekoladę mleczną i wanilię. Po chwili otwiera się jak kwiat, aby wydobyć z siebie nuty dębiny, drewna,melasy i miodu wrzosowego.
Tylko przez chwilę powiało słodami palonymi i delikatną kawą.
Aromat jest krzyżówką nut, które znam z Imperialnych Stoutów oraz Barley Wine.

Smak: To co mnie najbardziej interesuje w tym piwie, to oczywiście smak.
Trzeba dać mu trochę szansę. Początek wcale nie jest łatwy. 
Ot taki uniwersalny Imperial Stout bogaty w nuty czekolady, kawy z dodatkiem mleka, melasy, ciemnych owoców i orzechów migdałowych.
Po znacznym ogrzaniu trunku, zaczynają się pojawiać ciekawe elementy: miód wrzosowy, przyprawy korzenne, zioła, dębina i wanilia.
Szlachetny alkohol rozgrzewa w klatce piersiowej. Tekstura Kaggen’a jest jedynie umiarkowania, na próżno można szukać tutaj gęstych, zawiesistych niuansów.
Pełnia zmienia się wraz z czasem, zmierzając do półwytrawnego finiszu.
Alkohol dobrze zakryty. 

Wysycenie: Średnie do niskiego.

Podsumowanie:

Närke Kulturbryggeri Kaggen Stomaktsporter 2016 - no cóż legenda, legendą, ale na kimś kto wypił już trochę wysoko ocenianych Imperialnych Stoutów w swoim życiu, nie zrobi to piwo większego wrażenia.
Należy mu oddać jednak honor za ciekawy profil smakowy, niestandardowy dodatek (miód wrzosowy), interesujące nuty beczkowe i gładki odbiór.

Z całym szacunkiem dla moich szwedzkich kolegów, którzy nakręcają spiralę wokół tego piwa - nie jest warte swojej ceny 😉

Nie ma się co zabijać dla tych 25 centylitrów.
Jest wiele ciekawszych i tańszych piw i to nawet w Europie.

Peace’n’love my dear Swedish mafia!!😉🍺💣🍻💥"
Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(1, 65)",3.3,"Aromat typowo porterowy - śliwki, ciemne owoce, słody palone, karmel, do tego dębina, sporo czekolady, kawa, na samym końcu miód wrzosowy, ciutka wanilii, aromat bardzo złożony i robiący tym samym bardzo dobre wrażenie.
Smak - faktura bez żadnego szału, w kierunku niskiej, na starcie bardzo słodka, przeszkadzająca i nieprzyjemna melasa, ciemne owoce, przesłodzona kawa, delikatne migdały, lekko palony finisz i nieduże rozgrzewanie w gardle, wraz z ogrzewaniem wychodzi wanilia, miód wrzosowy i dębina, również ogólnie sprawiające niemiły odczucie. Ogólnie piwo pije się bardzo ciężko, na siłę, butelka jest maciupka, a i tak zmuszenie się do jej wypicia to duży wyczyn. Najbardziej wyhajpowane piwo ever, sporo polskich RISów pije się przyjemniej, zagadką dla mnie jest skąd ta wysoka ocena. Jedynym plusem jest aromat. Ogólnie nie polecam!"

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(1, 69)",4.7,"Fat på Närke Kulturbryggeri, 15 årsjubileum. Testad som 2008 och 2016.

2008: Svart med gräddig beigebrun krona. Kola, riktigt krämig saltlakritsfudge, svarta vinbär, tjärpastill, lakritsremmar. Stor, fin kropp med mycket fatkaraktär. Tanniner från eken är fint integrerad och ger en snygg syrlig ton tillsammans med sötma från bourbon och tjärpastill, rörsocker, fin maltsötma och rostade toner. Efter ett tag kommer mer fruktiga toner av mörka bär; typ björnbär och svarta vinbär. Fortfarande viss värme från alkoholen och fatlagringen, men det är så oerhört snyggt integrerat och sammanhållet. Smaken från de första munnarna ligger kvar långt och länge. Oerhört välgjort och så väldigt fint mognad. Samtidigt syns inte den minsta tendens på att den passerat sin peak. Mästerverk! 4,7

2016: Svart med tjusigt krämig beige skumpuck. Väldigt tydlig ljunghonungston i doften. Även mörka bär, björnbär/svarta vinbär, kaffesirap, tjärpastill, lakritsremmar. Ganska stor, rund och len kropp. Snygg fatkaraktär som fortfarande känns ganska ung och pigg. Sträv och lätt syrlig från eken. Lite eldighet och värme från alkoholen och fatlagringen. I smaken också honung, kola, bourbon, rostat socker, rörsocker, sötat kaffe, rom. Märkbart sötare och eldigare/spretigare än den äldre årgången. Gör sig nog väldigt väl av att ligga till sig. 4,5"

Aroma of both are epic, but there are differences. Aroma of 08 has more of the base beer shining trough, molasses, honey and overall very malty, while 09 has more iodine, medicinal and stronger characters shining trough. Flavors match both aromas perfectly, one being soft and gentle while the other one is powerful and strong. Both are boozy and sweet and very well balanced and rounded off. Surely getting the legendary status of this beer here. Great stuff, world class, even after all these years."

N: Oxide, cocoa, espresso, soy sauce, molasses, oak, marshmallow, and char. 

T: Very sweet, minorly bittered just enough to stop it from climbing off the cloying cliff.

M: Thick, oily body. No alcohol.

O: This is quite nice. The balance here is remarkable, and as such, this is much better than most IRSs I have had. I kind of wish I had tried this next to something like Courage. Seems like there’d be a correlation, but I can’t confirm."

When I first tried this beer, a 2008 vintage bottle in 2011, it was the best beer I ever tried and I think that bottle is still the best beer I ever had so far. The aroma was perfect, I didn’t want to drink it, I could smell it the whole night! The taste of that silky beer was perfect too! My score is affected from that bottle.

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(1, 96)",4.2,"Thanks to the Birthday Boy, Craig ""Swiftkey did it"" Garvie - 2008 Vintage

Opaquest dark brown, a total black hole swirl of a tan head. Rich sugary dusting. Dark smooshed figs, toasted coconut and isolated grab of raisins as it warmed and a welcoming porty porter core. Initial taste is a proper shotgun burning raidance of Meaty, juicy darkest malts - treacly charred sweetness seeping through. Vanilla pod crackles. Soily/dusty coffee dryness. Stabbing richness towards the finish, speckled fizzing out heat on the finish. A lot more layered and flavorsome than a Dark Lord, although a little more chewy meaty and leap at the finish - it’s up there and it’s mysticality will only increase each year this isn’t made.

June 2014 rating. Vintage 2008. 250mL bottle sent from teorn88 (thanks so much, Matteo!) – been trying to hunt one of these down for several years now! Pours jet black with a very small tan head. Nose brings out lots of woody oak, roasted malt, and maybe some dry powdery cocoa. Flavour is fairly complex, with lots of oak and wood, medium roasted malt, and maybe some dried overripe fruits. Very woody and oaky, which are the flavours that dominate. Extremely soft palate, with low carbonation – no hint of oxidation. This is surely excellent, but number 1 in the world?

An amazing beer, the nose is hard to pin down but each sip reveals different flavors & the aftertaste lingers while continuing to reveal new tastes. Umami, meaty wonderful stuff. Everything about this beer lingers from the smell, to the taste, the aftertaste & the head of foam. It’s become very reddish after warming up for a few hours while the taste gets smokey.

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 16)",4.7,"Some kind of celebration punching my 4K rating at RateBeer. I’m not really that concerned with numbers but sometimes it could be fun to do something extra about millstones anyway. The truth is I’m such a lacy rater so barely 50 % of my notes end up here. The big advance of this is the fact that it’s quite easy to grab something interesting from my notes and make it my “celebration”. So what could be more appropriate than world greatest Imperial Stout. I’m lucky to have sampled this by several occasions, but this 2007 vintage where pulled out of my cellar late one evening after a great beer tasting session. Everyone had gone home and I just felt for splitting this bottle with my beer buddy Gunnfryd. The big question where if it still was able to kick balls after a set of other superb ales (lots of good memories from those days my buddies cared to bring fine beers at our beer evenings). Back to the beer. Pours pitch black with a small but nice, dense brown head. Body feels thick and heavy with a appropriate moderate level of carbonation. A sight for sore eyes. Strong aroma of everything dark, like dark, roasted malt, dark fruit, dark chocolate with leather, wood and smooth, refined alcohol. Flavor is sweet but in perfect balance with the bitterness and alcohol. Everything from the aroma is present in such a perfect and smooth combination. The body feels perfect and it has a really long aftertaste, still soft as silk, rich malt, pleasant wood and warming alcohol. Pure pleasure."

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 18)",4.2,"2007 bottle, from trade with GTH. At last! One of the really big White Whales and a very appropriate selection for my 3000th entry here on Ratebeer - what a ride it has been! :-) Pours a tar black body with a medium light beige head. Nose is coffee, deep malty tones, leather, tar, honey, hints of wood, alcohol, licorice and vanilla. Very elegant and bourbon-like, despite not having touched any such barrels. Taste is burnt toast, licorice, coffee, leather, dark chocolate, dark malts, honey and hints of cellar must and alcohol. Medium body, soft carbonation. Very nicely balanced and well brewed, but times have certainly changed and while Kaggen might have been the top dog some years ago it’s no longer rare to encounter world-class imp stouts like this anymore. Regardless, this beer is still a beauty. Hats of to Närke for their accomplishments, and my toast to all the wonderful, cooky, funny, knowledgeable, geeky, hospitable and cheerful beer geeks here on the site. Chin chin for you all! :-)"

A - Pours oily, totally black out of the bottle into the glass. A 2 finger coffee colored head forms and fades over the course of 90 seconds to a thin ring and minor sea-foam consistent bubbles. The stickiness of the head is resilient as it swirls around in the glass. Pitch black, not oily but pretty damn black in the glass. 



S - Nose is interesting. I get almost a mix of espresso creamy latte with lactose and fresh roasted coffee mixed with the sweet booziness of rum barrels. There is a hint of vanilla beans and dark chocolate.



T - Interesting. This may be the most roasted beer I’ve ever had like a mix between roasted coffee and roasted oak over a fire. Not campfire smokiness but just very roasted. There’s a huge chocolate presence at the start, the middle is latte with vanilla added and the finish is this roast bomb with an almost astringent booziness like what you get after drinking cheap cough medicine. In the back of my throat I get a grain alcohol like taste like swallowing freezing cold vodka but the burn is always the same.



M - Velvety and sort of fudge like but you know the feeling you’re left with after eating chocolate covered espresso beans? that’s pretty much what this feels like but in liquid form.



O - I’m overall pretty disappointed in this beer. Tickers GOTTA tick but I really don’t feel that this is worth either the hype or the trade bait. There’s too much roasted notes, way too boozy for a 9.5% beer and the astringency never goes away. It’s a great stout but certainly one that I’ll pass on at the next bottle share should it show its face."

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 21)",4,"A black colored beer, with a small thick beige head. The aroma of dark malts, some smoke, coffe, chocolate, with some liquorice juice. The taste of smoked malts, dry bitter chocolate, some coffee and wood. Great combination."
Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 22)",3.9,"(Original review 2012-08-16): 2007 bottle shared by (and split with) blatantdream. Thanks! 



Almost zero release of air pressure when opened. Viscous body pours from the tiny bottle leaving minimal bubbles up top but no actual head. Chocolate and roasted malts swirl amongst toffee in the nose, creating a delicate aroma that simply isn’t strong enough. The first victim of age, perhaps? 



Stormaktsporter boasts an intense, potent, complex flavor profile. Deeply roasted malt; rich, decadent chocolate; booze character integrates marvelously with the stout base. Not super complex, but the chocolate in this beer is arguably the best of any stout I’ve encountered. Also, the balance here is impeccable. 



Massive body carries all of these flavors to my palate. Rockin’ mouthfeel. Somehow, this ~5-year-old bottle is completely void of oxidization. 



This stuff is great... Such a shame the bottles are so tiny (not to mention absurdly difficult to acquire). Color me impressed."

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 40)",4.5,"[Bottle] purchased at the football pub in Rome. Pours a clear black with a creamy tan head that slowly dissipates. The aroma has a surprising amount of crystallized, floral honey, light roast, very light barrel, and chalky malt. The flavor has a little more balance. The honey is strong still, lots of floral notes, stronger barrel character than you would think on the aroma, toasty on the back end, and the finish lingers with a little bit of everything there. Nicely complex, but the main thing about this beer is the balance. the aroma is a little less so, but the flavor is stunning. The palate is a touch thin, especially for an imperial, but the alcohol only makes a very light appearance.

2009 vintage

The beer appears quite similar to the standard version. Dark brown, nearing black, with a dark beige head that leaves an oily film gently descending the snifter.

A distinctly European aroma. It seems to me that Närke, Nøgne Ø, Mikkeller, etc. possess distinctive characteristics not found in American stouts. Hooray for diversity and the unique aspects found in beers throughout the world. Anyhow...the beer smells terrific. Roast, chocolate, barrels, a touch of booze.

The flavor does not disappoint. Thick, chewy, viscous stout that coats the palate and melts in your mouth. The barrel character is outstanding. Present, but not overbearing. Beautifully balanced. Dark fruits, chocolate, roast, malt, barrels blending together in harmony.

Highly recommended, should you have the good fortune to sample this."

Some strange metallic fish scale notes. Mouth is rich and swells with alcohol in the mouth, especially compared to the unoaked. I definitely preferred all the vintages of those. Although this is quite nice, it’s a bit of gilding the lily for me. Also the fish notes are strange--my lasting impression is of a German Chocolate cake doused in fish sauce."
Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 49)",4.3,"2007 nip bottle at Akkurat in Stockholm.  A few days earlier I drank full bottles of the 2006 and 2008 Stormaktsporter, and while both were considered very, very good, I felt the 2006 was faded and the 2008 was still a bit too bright and green.  This led me to choose the 2007 as the Kaggen! vintage to try at Akkurat a few days later.  My previous rating is from a nip bottle of the 2005, split two ways in 2008, sampled amid a number of other beers of varying style, bitterness and alcohol.  given the tendency of Narke beers to be somewhat mellow, focusing more on presenting a flavorful, balanced beer drinking experience rather than a bold, in-your-face drinking experience, my thoughts were lost, only preserved in notes taken four years ago.  So I truthfully had no opinion about the Kaggen from that long-ago taste.  I decided on this trip that I would experience Narke Stormaktsporter as if it were completely unknown to me.  The hype surrounding the beer is hard to ignore, but I feel like I can be honest with myself about quality given all of the things I’ve drank, where I’ve been in my beer travels, and how often I seem to go against the grain.  I’ve spent untold amounts of money on beer I didn’t enjoy, cheap and expensive both.  I trusted myself to honestly evaluate the Kaggen without consideration of rarity, reputation or pricetag. Combine this with the fact that so many people have had 4.5+ ""wow"" moments with this beer, and I know there’s something in here to find.  My previous rating was rather unexciting, so I figured I didn’t get the full experience, and this was my shot. So with that all said, how was the beer?  



First pour: early on the beer has limited expression given the temperature, a bit colder than is ideal. Early on the nose presents  a chewy and creamy melted chocolate chip dark malt character with light touches of faded whiskey and oak. The body is exceptionally savory and frothy, suggesting chocolate fudge and fluffy but savory cake.  There is slow growing alcohol warmth as the beer begins to blossom and open up with time, and after about 10 minutes it becomes difficult to put into words... surreal decadence, that would put it best. Prickly, just-bitter cocoa nibs and fudge cake softness with a velvety body.  Later on, approaching room temperature, the nose develops some metal and paint yeast notes but it’s really quite mild and doesn’t spoil the decadent spongy fudge cake deliciousness.  Some mild smoke and char are at play later on, and the whiskey remains happily subdued and well-matched for the moderate roast and soft, decadent body.  The last sips show a bit more whiskey and alcohol, as expected, but still remains creamy and chewy and perfectly suited for it’s size.  Delicious.  And no fish sauce whatsoever.



previous rating of 2005 vintage sampled in 2008: Appearance is deep black, no apparent light passing through the edges of my glass.  A deep brown head sites on top, and when swirled the brown, thick lacing clings to the sides of the glass and slowly crawls back down.  Very attractive splotchy lacing.  First impression of the nose is rich dark chocolate and a slightly hot aroma of whiskey with faint charred wood as well. For sure the whiskey is not overpowering, and I’d probably say it’s one of the few beers that used whiskey barrel aging is a truly complimentary role.  The (faint) char, rich (but not heavy) smoke, and malty scotch notes work together really, really well.  First taste is rich chocolate and sharp whiskey, again, complimentary rather than dominating, with oak barrel and delicate, toasted chocolate malts coating the mouth.  Over the back it’s slightly warming, very mellow and smooth, leaving a rich toffee, amaretto and resinous whiskey coating on the tongue.  A few times I even pick up some nice, moist tobacco as well."
Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 50)",4.7,"2009 bottle.  Some bottles come with so much hype that you really don’t expect them to live up.  This is a really special beer.  Dark beer with ruby hints around the edges when held against the light.  Brown ring and faint slick of a head in the snifter.  Huge nose dominated by the bourbon but with plenty of wood, smoke and alcohol notes.  Sticky brown bubbles while you drink.  Tons of bourbon flavors with oak, butter, molasses, over ripe fruit and some smoke.  Great oily mouthfeel and nice warming alcohol.  Incredibly complex and well balanced beer.  Many thanks to my Secret Santa for sending this bottle."

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 56)",5,"Bottle 2008 version, 0.3 taste 2007 version @ Närke Kulturbryggeri (Örebro, Sweden). *Hearty-rate*: the perfection in form of imperial stout. Drink it, period. *Rational-rate*: every time I have Kaggen! Stormaktsporter I never feel used to such a masterpiece. As I said to everyone: had many of the BIG IRS whales, like Black Tuesday, Darkness, Darklord, The Abyss, Eclipse, Dark Horizon, ecc., ecc., but this one tower above all. The reasons? Color is intense black, with a brown head like moka. But complexity starts from the aroma: you could never get enough of smelling, you touch something different every time. And difficult, extremely difficult to hive off single components. It’s burned sugar, molasses, apricot, oak, vanilla, plum, cherries, chocolate, coffee, syrup, spice, herbs. Bond between all that stuff is almost indivisible, even more in taste, it comes out an holistic property. Difficult to explain. But fact is, and could seem a paradox, separately from complexity, Kaggen! isn’t difficult to have, even though 25 cl is the best format, because hits directly the bull’s eye of senses without hesitation. You don’t need to be an experienced taster for appreciation and understand you’re facing something SO BIG. Moreover, it’s pointless making long analysis and list all flavors, since the best side it’s just the wholeness of such a full body; warms mouth and palate, in a great alternation between sweetness and bitterness (more the first) and the PERFECT balance of malts and hops. Herbaceous character, given by heather honey, isn’t invasive and oak aging as well. It’s ambrosia, no way. Breweries like Närke aren’t just their hype-geek productions, try other ones (cAmarillo, Örebro Bitter, and so on) and you’ll catch how they great could be as artisans. Long live HG and Berith."
Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 57)",4.7,"2008 bottle. Pours thick and black with an average brown head. Looks decadent. Nose is mellow yet potent at the same time. Light smoke, melon, spice, chocolate, roasted coffee, oak, apricot, maple syrup and alcohol.  Super complex. Flavor is sweet up front. Rich. Bitter peeks through and becomes more prominent in the middle and balances well for a bittersweet dry finish. Mouthfeel is like heaven on the tongue. Unreal how good this is. Believe the hype kids.

I’m not sure if this is the age of the bottle speaking here, but this was the most gentle and yet delicious imperial stout ever tried. It retained all the flavours os typical roasty ones, but without the sometimes overwhelming bitterness. This was less bitter then average RIS to me, it struck a perfect balance. And yet so much complexity. Heavenly. Body is thick and oily with a the perfect amount of carbonation. This is probably the first exceptionally-hyped beer that I truly enjoy as expected.

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 59)",4.4,"From notes.  First reviewed 10/30/2011.  Poured from a 8 oz. bottle into a tasting glass. 2008 vintage. 

Kaggen! Stormaktsporter has a typical RIS look - ebony black color with a fairly thin tan head of creamy bubbles slowly fades to a collar and leaves a thin sheet of lace. 

The aroma is very balanced and smooth. Some sweet bourbon, raisins, figs, and dark roasted malt are all subtle and blended so well together. Dark chocolate and a bit of espresso round out the nose.

The flavor is pretty much exactly what I want out of a barrel aged imperial stout. Smooth, sweet bourbon comes in first and slowly lets in the fig, raisin, cherry, and roasted malt blend beautifully together. Some dark chocolate fudge, vanilla, and light espresso notes are in the background. The finish has a bit more bourbon and finishes fairly clean.

The carbonation is smooth, with just enough crispness to excite the tongue along with the bourbon. The body is on the fuller side of medium and consistent all the way through. Slightly sticky on the lips.

Clearly, this is one of the best imperial stouts I have had. No individual flavor really stands out, but the flavors in concert work so well together."

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 71)",4.6,"2006 bottle, thanks Craig!! Pours a black colour with a thin tan head. Aroma of rum and raisin chocolate, cocoa and chocolate. Delicious port wine, dark chocolate and cacao nib flavours. Very well masked alcohol. Choc drops to finish and a lovely oily mouth-feel. Some oak and whiskey notes. Nicely bitter. Phenomenal!"

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 73)",5,"#800 Rating. Denmark, Ulfborg tasting with J&C (in 2009). Thanks to the tremendous generosity of Jan and Charlotte I got to try this gem at the end of our tasting when we visit them for the first time. I can’t deny that I had very high expectations and really wanted for it to fullfill them. Did it ? Hell yeah ! 2006 Bottle, served in a wonderful de molen snifter. It pours pitch black, thick and oily in the glass creating a small but wondeful deep brown head. The wonderful raosted aroma, with the coffee and chocolate notes and a slight hint of vanilla, tar and wood. So complex and as it warms it becomes even better But nothing can prepare you for the taste that is about to follow. The roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, wood notes, soem distant ripe fruit. So many flavors , so wonderfully balanced together. What really amazes me though is how easily it drinks despite it’s ABV, you feel lie you can have (in my dreams) many many glasses, which is rarely the case with big Imp stouts. I can’t give it anythign but a perfect score and I really doubt that I will do this for another beer (certainly hope so though :D ).
Added now (as the rating is from 2009). Having had this on many more occasions and in many vintages, my original rating hasn’t changed a bit. i wish I could drink this every day."
Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 74)",4.6,"2009 edition shared with OleR at Tre Små Rum, Gøteborg. Uh, how to start this review, maybe to state that this beer is not overrated at all. And it pours pitch black with a small creamy beige head. The aroma is just lovely deep malty, roasted coffee, chocolate and vanilla. Very thick and filling mouthfeel, yet smooth and velvety. Taste is mellow with an overall lingering liquorice and tar combination, wood and oak, underneath a good roasted malty body. This was an absolute faboulos experience."
Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 75)",4.9,"Bottle shared at Haggerty’s Fantasy Tasting. Who else has offered up #1 and #2 on the same night? Chris, you are ridiculous. This amazing brew has notes of fermented honey, pretty dense fruit, and earthen aromatics. Unending complexity. Rich, sweet malt, dark chocolate, and raisin flavors. Full body, thick/slick/creamy texture, and a roasted oaked finish. I’m blown away."
Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 76)",4,"bottle courtesy of Polly from Avenue Pub at Beer Bar Owner Gathering 2011, Good but falls victim of preconcieved notions. Notes of vanilla, dried fruits, light peat, licorice, pretty complex. Sample was about 2oz so i would love to try mote. Lighter mouthfeel than expected. Not sure of the year but good not amazing IMO"
Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 77)",4.3,"Sampled at our Halloween whale tasting.  Bottle was a 2008 vintage, Thanks Paul.  Pours like motor oil with about a half fingers worth of cocoa-colored head.  Nose is rather underwhelming, it is heavy on the dark fruit and has hints of vanilla, smoke, honey, tobacco, some blackstrap molasses, and oak.  The taste follows the nose quite closely.  Lots of dark fruit, smoke, honey, brown sugar, and chocolate...definitely the highlight of the beer.  It is on the thicker side and coats the palate nicely with light carbonation.  Excellent imperial stout, I can definitely see why this gets the hype it has.  I was a little let down by the nose for this being a world class imperial stout."
Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 78)",4.6,"From a bottle at SMÖF 2011. Dark beer. Licorice, tar, dark chocolate, vanilla and a bit smokey aroma and flavor. Nice balance and a lovley beer. 2008 years version."
Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 79)",4.8,"2008 bottle.
Pours pitch black, with a faint reddish hue, beige head.
The aroma is heavily roasted and fantastically complex. Dark chocolate, mint, coffee, tar, malt, tobacco, honey, candied sugar, along with balanced notes of wood, vanilla and tobacco..
Quite sweet, full bodied, high bitterness, creamy CO2.
The taste reflects everything from the aroma, together with wood, vanilla, licorice, mint, and an astringent tannin structure. Amazing. Again. (2011-10-28)"
Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 80)",4.4,"Black colour, small creamy tan head. Aroma somewhat sweet, quite balanced, liquorice, caramel, bourbon, honey, vanilla and nuts. Some roasted tones. Flavour is somewhat sweet, malty, liquorice, honey, caramel and oak. Velvety creamy body, finish of liquorice. Very nice and great balance.

(From 25cL bottle @ DRBM 2011, courtesy of Menno)"
Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 81)",4,"Black body, 1 inch of brown head.

Aroma has a beautiful smoke and dark chocolate/coffee mixture. Heavily roasted malts and some ashiness. Barrel comes through very well. Charred oak and light caramel.

The barrel is upfront in the flavor. It hides a lot of the depth and complexity that the base beer had. I don’t get as much of the sweetness and the ashy flavor is a little toned down. The alcohol cuts through that and leaves an acidic heavily roasted malt/coffee flavor on the palate. Lots of dark cocoa charred oak and light caramel. Creamy mouth feel with low-medium carbonation."
Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 82)",4.5,"2008 bottle courtesy of the infamous daknole -- many thanks, my friend!!  I had been looking forward to this for a long time, like most people who have this beer, and I have to say that it did an amazing job of living up to the hype.  Yet, I also have to say that we had this next to a COMPLETE vertical of Goose Island BCS, and Chicago definitely held it’s own.  The beer smells of char, honey, vanilla, cocoa, and dark fruits.  Tastes of each with an even stronger note of burnt malts in the flavor and added notes of leather and tannins.  Certainly a work of art worthy of the attention."
Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 83)",4.5,"Finally got to try this thanks to Menno for our DRbM 2011. Beautiful body with creamy small head. Amazingly rich smell and taste. Vanilla, nuts, mocha. Balanced but never boring. (DRbM 2011) (Rating re-indexed)"
Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 84)",4.3,"25 cl bottle vintage 2009 @ Man in the Moon, Stockholm. Rated on 14.05.2011

Aroma has roasted malt, chocolate, oak and lots of vanilla typical to bourbon aged IS. The bourbon comes a bit too much through here. Very smooth and thick palate like the basic stormakts has. Flavour is rich and very complec with bourbon, honey, vanilla and chocolate. At the end of the glass the bourbon has covered my whole mouth and the thick palate has become really sticky. 25 cl of this is really enough. Kind of reminds me of Goose Island Bourbon County, but this is slightly better. Worse than the non-Kaggen version though.

8-4-8-5-18 = 4.3

25 cl bottle vintage 2018 @ home. Rated on 11.2.2023

Aroma has bourbon, cocoa and some vanilla. Also licorice. Flavour has alcohol, bourbon, dark chocolate. A bit sharp on alcohol, perhaps would still need some ageing.

It’s quite sweet with vanilla, prunes, chocolate and some liquorice. Taste is enormous and sweet with roasted malts, milk chocolate, bourbon, alcohol, wood, vanilla and small hints of arrack. Bitterness is rather dry and suits the brew well. Finish is dry with a slight sourness. It has lots of coffee and some roasted coconut in it. Aftertaste lasts for almost an hour...

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 86)",4.2,"2006 bottle at Akkurat. Let me start by saying this beer was so hyped in my mind that I was a little disappointed after drinking it. At over $60 for a small bottle it is definitely not a value.

Smells like old dusty wood, chocolate, vanilla, and honey. taste is the same. pours a very dark brown with a dark caramel head (thin). Overall very unimpressed considering it is ""the #1"", don’t get me wrong it is a great brew but just not what I was imagining..."

Delicious aroma’s of bourbon-whiskey, oak, soy sauce, roast, mocha, vanilla. Flavor is sweet-ish and woody. Pretty strong alcohol feel. Finishes with roast (somewhat acidic), wood and some bitterness. Another great bourbon barrel aged impy. My highest rating to date."
Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 89)",4.4,"Fantastic Imperial Stout. Vintage tried, 2009. Pours black with a slightly weak brown head. Even a small sip is like circus on your taste buds. Very full bodied. Sweet, holy chocolate poured from the belgian masters secret wells, slight burned by swedish dark glass blowers, aromas of coffee from a perfect 1 euro espresso served by a milanese barista topped with vanilla from a secret paradise island. In all quite OK."
Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 90)",4.2,"2006 bottle bought on import. Pours almost jet black with red-brown tinges and a fine brown head that vanishes fast to leave an slightly oily look. Aroma is vanilla, a little oak, old port wine and a touch of honey. Initially a little musty and dusty on the palate, then the slightly oily texture reveals chocolate, coffee, a little more vanilla, and a touch of red fruit. The aftertaste is dry and spicy with hints of honey and mocha. By the way, they’re not wrong about the minimum temperature - it really does bring the richness out."

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter,"(2, 96)",4.5,"One of my long time wants.  ’08 Bottle served right after the regular version.

A- Pours opaque black with a small half finger tall mocha colored head leaving little to no lacing down the glass.
S - Smells just like the regular version with a few extra things tossed in. Compared to the regular version this one has a bit more vanilla, charred oak, peat whiskey, and just the faintest sour note. Excellent stuff.
T - Just like the regular version the taste is a bit of a letdown from that amazing nose but with the addition of the cask maturation it has really helped to round things out. Hints of rich bakers chocolate, sweet vanilla and charred oak tannins, licorice, dark fruits, and a tiny bit of light soy sauce. Only the faintest hint of alcohol creeps in as it comes to room temperature. The finish is a mix of sweet dark roast and some dry wood tannins, lingering for a short period of time.
M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Silky smooth feel with a mix of sweetness and dryness lingering through the finish. Only the faintest hint of booze can be detected.
O - Damn, I really wish I had a few more of these. I don’t like to say that a specific beer is the best I have ever had, but if you asked me what is the best RIS I have had this would be near the top of my list. I am glad I could share this one with a few people who could appreciate it as much as I did."

Pitch black pour with a medium tan to light brown head. Chocolate nose with a bit of booze along with dark fruit notes of fig and raisin along with tobacco, wood and roast. Woody flavor at first with strong dark fruit character (raisin, cherry and fig) with a bit of alcohol and a roasty chocolate finish. Amazing brew worthy of the praise it gets."

I like the aroma a lot, the mead smells like cherries, raspberries, black currants, honey and some earthiness.  Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also a hint of floralness too.  It's fruity, sweet and jammy, but with a nice tart kick too.  Lots and lots of flavor!  Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and syrupy with pretty much no carbonation.  I thought this was an excellent mead, definitely worth trying if you ever get the chance!"

The raspberry is there for solid backup and a little sweetness to get it going. The currant offers a whole different level of complexity.

For such an elegant mead, I am surprised that this makes me want a spicy habanero pepper steak fajita, black bean and corn salsa, and a slightly over cooked Spanish rice."

Appearance: Beautiful deep vibrant ruby red that leaves nice legs on the glass. 



Aroma: Burst of currants and black cherries alongside honey, floral/tea presence, light cinnamon / nutmeg, jammy fruits and port character. 



Taste: Sweet, but perfectly balanced by the moderate acidity. Burst of cherries and currants alongside deep honey presence, floral notes, light nutmeg, a touch of alcohol and port notes.



Palate: Full body. Thick. Mouth coating. Syrupy. Warming finish. Lingering fruity sweetness. Fruity finish and aftertaste. Perfect! 



Overall: One of the tastiest beverage I have ever had. So rich! The fruit presence is massive, but also really well balanced by a perfectly dosed acidity and a wonderful honey depth. We had it just after KBBS and HoD completely blew away the Toppling Goliath stout. Simply amazing!"
Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"(1, 61)",4.6,"2 oz pour from bottle. Pours a beautiful opaque burgundy. Aroma is huge cherry, currants and other fieldberries. There is also an intriguing spiciness and chamomile from the honey. Taste is quite tart, certainly more than I expect. It also has a nice sweetness from the fruits (cassis and dark cherries) and a light bitterness (peel, cherry pit). Very complex and well balanced. The lingering fieldberry taste makes you wanting more. Awesome mead."
Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"(1, 62)",4.5,"2oz pour from Bottle. Deep vibrant Clear purple red pour. Aroma is so rich, same intensity as statement reserve but so much currants, fresh currant preserves homemade jam, fruit skins, so jammy, tons of fruit, lots of raspberry as well, chamomile, orange, nutmeg. Taste is rich fruity, nice fruity bite, so rich, sweet fruitiness but actually well attenuated, very bright currant, cherry flavor. Palate is relatively dry, really incredibly easy to drink, nice warmth on the finish. Amazing stuff."

Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"(1, 65)",4,"Pour at brewpub. Rich, robust cherry notes on the nose. If you hold it to the light it’s just the most glorious ruby red. Big cherry notes on the tongue which pairs nicely with nicely bitter local chocolate they just gave me. Finishes clean. It’s pretty great but I actually think the statement is slightly more awesome."
Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"(1, 66)",4.8,"Sample at meadery of batch #2. $10 for a 1oz pour, and totally worth it. I don’t think I’ve ever had something so wonderfully flavorful."

Aroma is dark cherry skins and black currants mostly. Very rich. Don’t get any raspberry. Tastes surprisingly more like wine than mead. Not nearly as sweet as I expected. It is deep and rich though. Just like the aroma, I get more cherry skin and black currant than raspberry. Slightly tart. Slightly dry. Great mouthfeel. Smooth and just the right amount of syrupy. Overall, a great mead but there are a few mead’s from Ken that I enjoy more and cost a quarter of the price. I doubt I’ll ever purchase it again."
Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"(1, 70)",4.5,"Bottle: The aroma consists moderate cherries, raspberries, vinous, and a touch of alcohol. It’s a very dark deep red with no head.

A superb melomel!"
Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"(1, 72)",4.5,Bottle. Pours a clear very deep dark purple with no head whatsoever.

Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"(1, 81)",4.8,"Berry and perfume smell. Concentrated verrrrrrry tart berry taste with tannin notes. You can taste the raspberries, cherries, and currants individually. Delicious."
Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"(1, 82)",4.3,"Big thanks to dak for sharing this and a gentleman’s nod to Meadme for . . . well, being awesome and being Meadme. Cheers Greg! The tall glass bottle pours with a deep purple body that has rosy red edges and leaves behind slightly staining swirls and decent legginess. The aroma offers up thick berry notes before it heads into some dark currant goodness and a dash of honey wax. The taste smoothly flows into rich dark currant juiciness, berry richness and then a bit of tannin like tartness. The tartness seems to try and break up the rich deep berry goodness but is unable to. This starts to pick up currant berry earthiness toward the finish but the tannic tartness snuffs it out. This was surprisingly different than the batches from the B. Necktar version."
Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"(1, 83)",4.4,"Super blood red. No head. Nose is huge. A ton of fruit. Like crap loads. Taste is incredible. Just a crap load of strawberry, cranberry, raspberry and cherry. Just stupid crazy good. Whoa This was batch 2 w/ the schramm’s label not b.nektar. This is an incredible mead!!! try this if you can."
Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"(1, 84)",4.3,"Big thanks to Adam Jackson for this bottle share. Dark ruby color, that looks like a red wine color. Aroma is lots of fruit. Black cherry, raspberry, perhaps a blueberry with hints of currents. 


Flavor is massively sweet with again, huge amounts of berry. No amount of alcohol even at this level of ABV, damn! The berry concoction of berries is crazy with a very light hint of honey in the finish. I know the price point is really high but after tasting this I understand why. Really crazy, smooth, yet sticky texture. Yeah, that doesn’t make sense. However this is really tasty and can’t imagine any other mead this flavorful."
Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"(1, 85)",4.1,"Dark purple color. Aroma of perfume, berries, honey. Flavor is sweet, tart, tannins, light vinous, drier than I remember the original HoD. Good but the B Nektar version is hands down better."
Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"(1, 86)",4,"Deep, dense purpleish blue pour. The nose is port like but with more cherries and black currant. Really nice. Texture is light to medium with no carbonation, obviously. Suits the rich, sour, fruity, pungent profile. The aftertaste is really lovely but its more of the same. A pleassure to have tried. Tried this a second time and felt my rating needed a slight nudge in the positive direction. 4.0 it is then.."
Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"(1, 87)",4,Taster at Schramm’s. Looks good; a semi-transparent still reddish purple. Smells good too; sweet cherry and honey with some other berry presence as well. Tastes like it smells with a pleasant mouthfeel. Great mead; overpriced though. I’d take Black Heart over this all day long for 40% of the price.
Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"(1, 88)",4.4,"The aroma is fruit - blackberry/currents. Pours a dark purple /red. The taste is sweet/bitter. The body is thin/medium, the carbonation soft and the finish long. Geez you have to go a long way to beat this - Best drink I’ve ever had so far."
Schramm's The Heart of Darkness,"(1, 89)",4.7,"Bottle at Greg’s bbq. Pours beautiful dark red lilac. Aroma is intense cherries black currants honey sweet alcohol. Flavor so fullbodied, like the aroma, fruity rich, truly enjoyable."

The taste is rich cherry, blackcurrant, bramble liqueur, some warming alcohol, light wood, and light tartness to balance it out with a dryish, bitter-sweet finish.

Clear ruby dark-brown pour with some drifting sediment and with an enormous effervescent beige head, retaining very well. Aroma is first hard to catch through this big head, but later sweet roast malts, caramel, dried fruits. Taste is over medium sweet, caramel, brown/candy sugar, chocolate, bit spicy maybe. Full mouth, good carbo for such a string beer. I don't want to be cheesily stubborn, obstinate or contrarian, but to me this brew is not exceptional or really 'wow', like everyone says. Sure, a very nice quad, tasty, typical Belgian, bit old-school, bit too sweet; but not really rich or complex, not developing in taste, not a surprising aftertaste etc. Simply nice; like other nice brews...."

Aromat: jest moc :). Sporo ciemnej skórki od chleba, karmelu, palonego cukru, tytoniu, ale bardziej takiego z którego cygara się skręca - ciemny dobry rum podobnie pachnie np krajem albo santiago, tutaj lekka wanilia również jest obecna. Dużo ciemnych suszonych Owocow tj śliwki, rodzynki, poza tym troche miodu, nut drożdżowych oraz fenoli typowych dla belgijskich piw. 


Smak: w ustach pełnia średnia, myślałem ze będzie pełniejsze, słodsze, bardziej likierowe i wyklejajace, a jest jednak lżejsze. Początek wytrawny, lekko szczypiący w policzki i język, po przełknięciu bardzo złożone, dużo karmelu, suszonych owocow, pieprzu, palonego cukru, do tego trochę wypieczonego ciasta, jednoczenie jest dużo fenoli i ziół, które pojawiają się natychmiast po przełknięciu co sprawia ze piwo jest wytrawne.

Na średniowysokim poziomie dominuje słodowość w postaci melasy, ciemnego miodu, orzechów laskowych, biszkoptów z toffi, brązowego cukru, przypieczonej drożdżówki, lekkiego karmelu i ciemnego chleba. Na drugim planie średnioniskie daktyle. W tle nuta drożdżowa. Fenoli brak, alkohol bardzo dobrze ukryty.
Smak: Złożony, wyraźniejszy niż aromat. Na pierwszym planie słodowość z aromatu na średniowysokim poziomie. Drugi akord należy do pieprzowych fenoli oraz gładkiego, pieprzowo – różanego oraz lekko rumowego alkoholu na średnim poziomie. Fenole i alkohol dodatkowo podbudowane są niskim ziołowo – korzennym chmielem. W tle nuta daktyli. W ustach słodkie, treściwość średnia – gładka, wysycenie niskie, średnioniskie rozgrzewanie alkoholu. Goryczka średnia, ziołowo – korzenna, lekko alkoholowa, średniej długości – wyraźnie kontrująca słodowość. Finisz półsłodki z goryczką lekko przeważająca nad ciemnym miodem, brązowym cukrem, nutą karmelu oraz rumowym alkoholem."

Westvleteren 12,"(1, 23)",5,"BESTES QUADRUPPEL!!! UND BESTES BIER DER WELT!!!
Das Westvleteren 12 führt einige Tasting Listen an und ist auf Youtube auch unter dem Begriff ""Bestes Bier der Welt"" zu finden. Es kommt dunkelbraun mit beiger, gemischtporiger Krone ins Glas, die eine mittlere Standfestigkeit hat. Der Geruch erinnert an einen Mostkeller mit hohem erdigen Anteil. Besonders auffällig ist der Alkohol. Beim Antrunk hatte ich eine Geschmacksexplosion erwartet, die einen sofort und für immer umhaut. Nichts dergleichen. Das Quadrupel kommt dezent mit Pflaume, Likär, Beeren, Vanille, Zartbitterschokolade und leichtem Karamell rüber. Dabei ist das Bier leicht süß aber gerade noch so, dass es richtig männlich ist. Bestimmt bekomme ich für den Kommentar wieder Haßposts. Ich erahne noch weitere Aromen, möchte sie aber aus Unsicherheit nicht benennen. Zweite Verkostung nötig. Ich habe gar nicht gemerkt, dass das Bier schon fast leer ist, deshalb nun der Abgang: Der Alkohol gewinnt an Dominanz und bringt zusammen mit der Hopfung eine merkliche und sehr gut abgestimmte Bitterkeit ins Spiel. So können die vorher genannten Aromen, die immer noch da sind, in einem anderen Licht erlebt werden. Absolut phantastisch gelöst. Garantiert ist das das beste Quadrupel, das ich je getrunken habe. Zu dem besten Bier: ich glaube nicht, dass dieses Bier in Kuba am Strand bei 34 Grad das beste ist oder es einem Radler Liebhaber gefallen würde. Deshalb ist der Begriff für mich auch lächerlich und für jeden Betrachter anders. Ich finde es auch nicht nachvollziehbar für so ein Meisterwerk 3 Sterne zu vergeben, aber so sind eben die unterschiedlichen Geschmäcker.

Finally, the world-famous Westvleteren XII has made it to my home and what better way to add my rating than with a young example? Obviously, I'm looking forward to drinking aged examples in the coming years...
Pours a hazy dark amber to brown with a stable, foamy, tan head. Very expressive aroma of tawny port, red wine, wood, red apple slices, dried banana, pear, overripe blue plum, brown bread, baker's yeast, artisan milk chocolate, chestnut. Taste has a sweet estery mix of blue plum, red apple, dried banana & raisin in a thick brown-bready, slightly toasty, somewhat chocolatey malt body with a hint of candi sugar, but never in a cloying way, surrounded by a spicy and a dry-yeasty note, and even a sourish dark-fruity streak. The herbal & peppery hoppy finish offers more dried & candied fruits, spices and 'dry' brown bread and even a very vague hint of coffee. The whole is topped off with a noble, vinous warmth of brandy-like alcohol. Medium to full body, creamy-moussy texture, average carbonation (toning down when warming up). Evidently, it's hard to approach this beer unbiasedly, but its powerful character slowly but surely reveals itself, leaving you without a doubt that it's a masterpiece."

Tastes of sweet bread, sweet toffee, dried fruit, cloves, caramel/brown sugar. Longlasting aftertaste with a hint of licorice, especially if swirled around for a bit. The ABV carries the taste nicely and is not felt at all.

Very, very well balanced with a pleasant level of carbonisation. Best beer in the world? Hard to tell, but it is really, really good stuff and for a moment I thought about what an barrel aged edition might taste like."
Westvleteren 12,"(1, 35)",4.4,"Pours a deep, dark mahogany coloration with a ruby red hue when held up against the light and a medium, fluffy head. Smells of bready, caramel malt, dark fruit and estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana clove and allspice, as well as just a hint of brown sugar. Taste is an excellent balance of bready, caramel malt and dark, estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana, clove and allspice, as well as hints of chocolate, brown sugar and licorice. Finishes with a medium sweetness and some estery fruit and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and low/medium carbonation.

While I didn't want to admit it, simply due to the ridiculous secondary price, this certainly is one of the finest Quads that I've ever had. I still don't think that it's worth 5 times the price of Rochefort or Bernadus Quadruple, but from memory it does stand just slightly above these simply due to balance and body/mouthfeel. The balance of sweet and spicy notes really is excellent here, with a very rich estery character, body and mouthfeel. Overall, this makes for a very rich and well-balanced Quad that may not be worth its secondary price, but still stands on it's own incredibly well, with the ABV hardly being noticeable at all. I think that it's the richness, smoothness and balance which makes this stand just slightly above similar offerings, but from a value-for-money standpoint I'd still rather have a Rochefort 10."

Opaque and dark brown with lots of yeast sediments. Deep, earthy, and sweet aroma with clear notes of nuts and figs, finishing with vinous alcohol. Intense, incredibly deep and complex taste. Starts off with slight notes of citrus, rounding over in figs, nuts, honey, cocoa, slight coffee. This is followed by a slight bitterness before it ends in chocolaty feel. Full-bodied oily texture and very foamy. An incredible experience. The people who claim that Sint Bernardus Abt 12 is like this beer are incredulous, for lack of better word. Beats that firmly, and even edges out my old favourite: Trappistes Rochefort 10.

Westvleteren 12,"(1, 45)",5,"Bevuta con particolare emozione sapendo dell'unicità dell'esperienza. Bottiglia in edizione speciale XII, BB 02/12/2014, dunque imbottigliata nel dicembre 2009. Invecchiata per quasi 12 anni. Schiuma praticamente assente, colore marrone scuro non torbido ma con molti lieviti sospesi anche al primo colpo. Carbonazione leggera. Al naso enorme complessità, su tutto caramello, frutta secca e di bosco, sentori erbacei. In bocca leggermente acquosa ma allo stesso tempo di buon corpo. Caramello e i tipici derivati dell'ossidazione dominano la bevuta, la frutta rimane sullo sfondo. Arriva poi uno delizioso amaro che porta diverse pennellate erbacee e floreali, accentuando anche il resto dei sentori. Finale dolce ma secco, che assume anche una nota acida e tostata quando la birra sale di temperatura, oltre a un pelo di liquirizia. La transizione tra amaro e il finale è il più grande pregio di questa birra.
Un viaggio in un sorso, estremamente complessa ed elegante nonostante 11 anni di invecchiamento. Alcool che non si sente per nulla nonostante si avverta una parte quasi di rum. Mistica."

Het is wel de cultstatus die er mede aan bijdraagt dat dit bier door elke bierliefhebber zeker een keer gedronken moet zijn, gelul natuurlijk...mensen die niet van het type Quadruppel houden gaan dit ook niet lekker vinden omdat het Westvleteren is, en de verkrijgbaarheid is nog steeds RUK. Als het al verkrijgbaar is dan wordt het aan derden verkocht voor woekerprijzen, wat dan weer niet van de Cisterciënzers mag.

Westvleteren 12,"(1, 81)",3.9,"Bottle straight from the monastery, thx A.! This definitely was too fresh but after 6-10minthsxminimum cellar aging it finally came together nicely. Classical Belgian flavors full of fruity esters and malty rich backbone, aging integrates the alcohol and it’s not boozy, barely warming, dried apricots, faint figs, feels pretty thick and rich, simply a delicious and rich monastery beer and I just prefer the original over the knockoffs."
Westvleteren 12,"(1, 82)",4.8,"Aroma is sweet, dark fruits, plums, liquorice. Taste is sweet, plums, liquorice, booze. Best quad so far, waited 4 hours to order 3 crates on their website. Worth the time!"
Westvleteren 12,"(1, 83)",4.3,Sweet malt. Yeasty esters. Lovely Belgian ale that is very humble considering its reputation.
Westvleteren 12,"(1, 84)",4.2,"Did not have the occasion to drink this beer for a few years.  But the moment you take a first sip of this nectar... you instantly remember what the taste is like and you know why this beer was voted ""best beer of the world""...Period."
Westvleteren 12,"(1, 85)",5,"This beer was one dream for me and i try very hard to get one bottle without travel in Belgium. So before tried this unique beer i get the ""St bernardus 12"" because people said these two beers had the same recipe and are very similar. So i want to say to them :Its not the same beers. The difference are massive.
If we clear that lets go to the review.
When i open the beer one punchy full of flavors aroma fill my roam from nowhere. The aroma cover my entire room for fun. But the most shock thing wasent the aroma but the taste. When the beer touch my mouth, it bites my tongue and cover my entire mouth with insane flavors that i never had again. I had feel the same thing only once from ""Rochefort 10"" that also bites your tongue and your mouth very aggressive. But ""Westvleteren 12"" do that more aggressively. The beer has the best mouthfeel i ever get from anything in my life. 
The taste is so complex and so unique. The beer is very sweet and at the same time bitter with a lot of caramel, chocolate, fruity notes. And the finish it has 3 long directions. In the beginning it gives you one aggressive and punchy bitterness and in some secs that become sweet and again it change in some warm bitterness at the end. Really i cant described that. The feeling was mind blowing. The carboration is little high for one ""Quadrupel"" beer but it stick perfectly here.
Overall the best beer i have get/tried today. No because is the best on paper but because its the best for me. Simply the beer is a real monster. The most complex and unique beer i have tried for sure!"
Westvleteren 12,"(1, 86)",4.6,"Pours brown, small head.

Westvleteren 12,"(1, 88)",4.4,"330ml (10.2%) at home on 24 Apr 2020, present from Craig Garvie several years ago: woody, caramel, ethanol aroma, deep brown, ruby tint, thin beige head, no lacing, fruity, woody, caramel flavour, viscous, smooth, very sweet, no alcohol burn."
Westvleteren 12,"(1, 89)",4,"When I was young I did drink this beer almost every week. You could still buy as many crates as you liked. Now it became a kind of cult, phone the beer line, pay in advance etc. It's a great beer, but not in my top 20. I live the first impression full body, light sweet but not too sweet. I can't really describe it, but the after tastes reminds me vaguely about fermantated/ too ripe banana and that spoils it for me. The banana taste is also present in Stift Engelszell Gregorius Trappistenbier, one of the most disappointing Trappist beers. Most beers in my top 10 are at least 200 years on the market and all new Trappist beers lack something. St. Berbardus Abt 12 is in my opinion a good alternative if you like the aftertaste of Westvleteren 12 and the story that the yeast was stolen could be true. Both beers have a unique after taste..."
Westvleteren 12,"(1, 90)",4.8,"Color entre granate oscuro y marrón muy oscuro, turbia, casi opaca. Espuma beige de más de tres dedos de espesor y retención impecable. Aroma medio intenso, vino tinto, heno y paja al servirla, al atemperar aparecen ciruelas, uvas e, incluso, higos a medio camino de convertirse en pasas, también hay notas de plátano y, en menor medida, fresas, por último se intuyen notas espaciadas típicas del estilo como canela y clavo. Sabor ligeramente más intenso, en la línea del aroma empezamos con sensaciones vinosas y madera ligeramente ahumada, pasamos por regaliz y ligeras frutas oscuras y terminamos con notas especiadas y muy levemente licorosas, final medio, frutal y ligero amargor herbal, alcohol ligeramente presente aunque muy bien integrado. Textura semioleosa, llegando a ser un poco pegajosa en los últimos tragos. Carbonatación media alta al principio, aunque se calma rápidamente hasta llegar a ser media baja.

Un espectáculo, compleja y llena de matices que evolucionan durante toda la toma, imposible cansarte. Eso sí, hay que estar atento a las ofertas para poder repetir, el precio es prohibitivo."
Westvleteren 12,"(1, 91)",4.1,"Spoko piwo choć niczym szczególnym się nie wyróżnia. W aromacie karmel, melasa, suszone owoce, trochę jakby kawy zbożowej. W smaku podobnie. Jedyna zaleta jest taka że kompletnie nie czuć alkoholu. W obecnych czasach jest po prostu dobre. Polecam."

Westvleteren 12,"(1, 94)",4.4,"Ciężko porównać do jakiegokolwiek stylu, nie przypomina żadnego innego piwa jakie wcześniej piłem, smukłe i gładkie smak jakby karmelowy? w ogóle nie czuć alkoholu, rozgrzewa dopiero po chwili."

Appearance is murky, opaque dark brown with lots of sediment in suspension, nice sparkle at the edges of the glass, fizzy, ephemeral beige head with no lacing. Aroma is strong mix of sweet fruits including cherry, plum and fig, spice, caramel malts and mild alcohol. Taste follows aroma with mild tart fruit to go along with the sweet. Mouthfeel is light side of light-to-medium bodied with thin, frothy texture, average carbonation, pleasant esophageal alcohol warmth, and finish as taste. Overall, the look and feel do nothing for me but the aroma and taste are both very good. Not the transcendent experience I was anticipating but I enjoyed it."

Westvleteren 12,"(1, 98)",4.2,"Bought in Oct.2018, opened in Feb, 2020
Aroma: pear, apple, some dark dried fruit, caramel
Appearance: hazy dark amber to copper color with a massive lasting beige to tan head.
Taste: pear, apple, some dried dark fruit, caramel, medium-high sweetness, medium bitterness
Palate: medium-full body, medium consistency, medium dryness, medium alcohol sensation
Overall: Everything is in line with a Belgian quadrupel, don't expect any surprising flavor. But actually, the best part of this beer is its perfect balance and gentleness where non of the Belgian fruity ester, dryness, carbonation, malty character is over-expressing. The drinkability remains good even it returns to room temperature. Great."
Westvleteren 12,"(1, 99)",4,"Dark brown with notes of sweet raisins, caramel, dark fruits. Has some spice and honey flavored raisin notes. Semi sweet, light bitter and warm on the finish."
Westvleteren 12,"(1, 100)",4.7,"Bottle. Dark brown color with medium sized beige head, very creamy, lasting just very thin. Aroma is candied sugar, dark fruits, plum, dates, figs, some licorice, dark malts. Taste is very rich, candied sugar, chocolate, dried fruits, notes reminding maybe Port wine, spices. Finish is more on the sweet side, but the balance is perfect for me. Carbonation is quite low, lower than a St. Bernardus Abt 12. Alcohol very well hidden.
I don't know if it's better than a Rochefort 10, maybe yes because I prefer its lower carbonation. The only negative thing are the prices except at the Abbey. I am waiting to try an older version of it now."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 1)",4.3,"Amazing head. Amazing aroma, sweet biscuits. The flavor is plummy, not too sweet, perfect mix of bitterness and mild astringency at the end. Very complex with lots of yeast notes."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 2)",4.5,"Copenhagen 10/6 2018. 33 cl bottle from Den Belgiske Ølbutik, Vanløse. Nondescript bottle with no label. All information on the Golden Cap including the ABV and the Shield of St. Sixtus with a Palm Tree. 

Pours murky and hazy deep brown with big off-white head. Settles as 1 cm thick layer of foam sloping gently over the center of the glass. Moderate lacing. 

Aroma is sweetish, potent and with more than a hint of alcohol. Humid basement, light banana, caramel, raisins, hints of vanilla, woody alcoholic oak. Gets even more potent as the beer warms up. 

Soft carbonation. Medium thick smooth texture. A little sticky. 

Flavor has strong sweetness followed by and balanced by rather strong bitterness. Aftertaste is dense and sweet with bitter notes. Light alcoholic burn. 

Very fine elegant Quadrupe. Boozy without being brutal, discrete yet intense. The only thing I can complain about is that the bottle is so small."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 3)",4.8,"Surely One of the Best beers i tried.. Fantastic aftertaste .. Strong Wooden Aromas.. Could be compared too oak matured wine..

Westvleteren 12,"(2, 5)",4,"Shared 11.2 oz. (2019) bottle poured to a snifter showing a lightly hazed, amber/brown color, with a presentable layer of off white/tan froth. The nose was dried & dark fruit, caramel/malt sweetness, and Belgian spice. Medium+ bodied, with rather lively effervescence, and booze to match, the taste was similar notes, adding appropriate bitterness, resulting in a fairly well balanced Quad. (1/11/20)
Shared another 11.2 oz. bottle that was a 2012 version, with a bit more diversity to the fruit as added fig & date. The body seemed a little lighter, and carbonation was a bit milder, with decent alcohol presence, a touch of vanilla, and some added earthiness to the bitterness. Cellared extremely well. +.2 for consistency & balance."

Westvleteren 12,"(2, 11)",4.9,"330ml bottle at home via NL (thanks Vri!).  Excited to finally try this, it’s a three-year old, bottled 11/16.  Deep mahogany with a foamy beige head and good lacing.  Raisins, plums, cherries, nuts, toffee, dark bread, brown sugar, sweet malt.  Medium soft carb, medium-full body, beautifully smooth texture.  With all that, it’s still super-easy drinking with dangerously sneaky ABV.  Just delicious.  First beer of the new decade - it’s all downhill from here."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 12)",5,What is there to say about this one that hasn’t already been said? This is what Belgian beers should be. It’s not overrated. Great smell and very smooth on the pallet.
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 13)",3.8,"Bottle from 7,000 Jars of Beer, Kingston. Rich earthy nutty dark fruit aroma, with perfume in the tail. Opaque chestnut. Thick foamy beige head. Sweet with a sour edge to it. Spice. The booze then comes through in the finish. Thick bodied. Creamy. Fizzy carbonation. Long astringent. I know this is supposed to be amongst the best of the best but this sory of sweetness and spice does not particularly do it for me. It's an interesting beer but all a bit much and not one to session. Albeit once I'd sat here sipping it and it warmed up it seemed to smooth out. One to contemplate."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 14)",5,Best beer ever. I never discoverd a beer with this kind of taste. Wonderful.

Light bodied beer."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 16)",4.4,"Niezwykle wyraźnie przyprawowe, estrowe i pełne słodkich suszonych owoców. Bardzo intensywne, z leciutkim alkoholem na finiszu, pełne, praktycznie nie wysycone. Cechy oczywiście typowych mocnych Belgów, szczególnie w stronę wspomnianych estrów. Bardzo mocno pracujące drożdże. Wyraźna słodycz, ale piwo co najwyżej półsłodkie, a nawet półwytrawne. Bardzo intensywne, przebija się w smaku wręcz kilka poziomów, złożone, ciekawe i smaczne."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 17)",4.6,"330 ml bottle. Dark brown colour, small head with good durability, partly lacing, lively carbonation. Nose is malty, walnuts, chestnuts, dried plums. Flavour is medium sweet, light to medium bitter, caramel, raisins, walnuts. Well balanced, perfect creamy mouthfeel, good drinkability despite the high ABV. A great beer for sure."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 18)",5,"Drank one bottle in Belgium, and one in Norway. This beer is impressively well balanced. There is a sweetness to it that is firmly present, but at the same time mild in flavor. The beer hits all the buttons: it is fresh and light, but also full of flavor and has a long aftertaste. The aromas bring thoughts of honey and mead, while the tasting notes are full of cocoa and caramel. The warmth of the alcohol, which is at a notable 10 %, emphasizes the intensity of the sweet aromas. A very pleasant beer that is easy to drink, and which could convert many that are not too fond of darker beers."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 19)",4.6,"0.33l bottle from armando. Dark brown body, beige head, moderately persistent. Aromas of dried red fruits. Later mild cocoa and a smoky character also appears. Taste is dominantly malty/sweet and very complex. Nuts, dried fruits, a bit of caramel, roasted malt, a hint of smoked malt. Aftertaste is very mild on the bitter side. Moderate carbonation, mouthfeel starts with a fizzy outburst and then softens into mildness. Fairly strong alcohol, but still surprisingly light body for a 10+% ale. Complex, yet harmonic. Surely among the best beers I have ever tasted."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 20)",4.1,"W aromacie rodzynki, śliwki. W smaku też suszone owoce, delikatna kawa. Niestety trochę zbyt alkoholowy posmak."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 21)",4.9,"A magnificent quadruple! Dark, brown-red color and a modest head. Smell: red fruits with some citric fruits and subtle aromas of laurel and caramel. Taste: liquorice and dark chocolate. Some earthy, ashy notes as wel. Nice, red fruits sweetness, subtle hops but no pronounced bitterness. Full body. Smooth, vanilla and caramel finish, pleasantly lingering in the aftertaste. Very nicely balanced. Absolutely beautiful! It totally lives up to the expectation."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 22)",5,"En copa, cerveza muy oscura con una fina capa de espuma blanco hueso. Aroma intenso y muy complejo, encontrando fruta madura como ciruelas, higos y pera, especias como canela y clavo, cereales en grano, paja, levadura, pan, y una nota a chocolate. En boca, textura espesa y un poco oleosa, de carbonatación baja y amargor casi inexistente. Se encuentran sabores a cereales caramelizados, algo de chocolate, ciruelas, higos, mucha presencia de canela en rama, pan, bizcocho, levadura, y un fondo alcoholico final. Sin palabras. Hace honor a su nombre y a su fama. Sin duda, la mejor Quadrupel que existe. Aroma y sabor muy complejos y perfectamente integrados, con una explosión que estimula tanto gusto como aroma. Aunque cara, es una cerveza que hay que probar almenos una vez en la vida."

Westvleteren 12,"(2, 24)",4.7,"330ml bottle in 2012. Still one of my favourites (I know - I’m a walking cliche...). A very deep brown with a dense beige head. Aroma is huge and full with dark fruit, yeasty esters, malt, rye bread, raisins, prunes, dates, cinnamon, cloves and a hint of something almost meaty. Fantastic body. Smooth and incredibly big flavour. Loads of complexity and just so dang moreish!"
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 25)",3.1,"Butelka w wersji ponad 4-letniej. Piana raczej szybko opada do zera. W aromacie głównie suszone owoce, trochę domowego winiacza, świeższych winogron, trochę słodu w typie raczej chlebowym. O ile aromat wydaje się fajny, złożony, to w smaku piwo wypada raczej biednie - wytrawnie, kwaskowo, dość winnie, estrowo. W dodatku trochę grzeje alkoholem przy finiszu. Duży zawód, choć może to kwestia przeleżakowania."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 26)",5,Sorprendete. No soy muy aficionado a las cervezas tan oscuras. Y esta es deliciosa.

Westvleteren 12,"(2, 28)",4.5,"Bottle. 5/2/22 date. Appearance:  Dark murky brown with a light hint of ruby red. Minimal light khaki head. 
Aroma:  Alcohol, chocolate, toasted bread, and dark fruit, namely raisin. 
Taste:  Rich, super sweet maltiness, with strong brown sugar and toasted bread notes. Minimal bitterness is just enough to prevent the sweetness from being cloying. Raisin and tobacco notes come through on the back end. 
Mouthfeel:  Medium bodied with a biting carbonation. 
Finish:  Malt forward, but has a surprising amount of bitterness that’s sticky on the tongue. Brown sugar, molasses, and raisin all linger. 
Overall:  Rarely do beers live up to the hype, but this is truly a world class beer, even within a rich, complex style with plenty of great examples. Drinks surprisingly easy for a beer this complex and rich in maltiness. So many layers of flavor, all well rounded and smooth"
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 29)",5,"Not going to review this beer. So obvious when you taste this absolute gem. Try it yourself, if you can get it."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 30)",4,"A discovery from the bottom of my cellar. BBE 8/2011 so quite appropriately aged. Pours clear chestnut brown. Nose of spice, raisin, dust, herbs, a hint is brown sugar. Herbs, molasses, more of the dust. Medium body with a wife bouquet and just a hint of sourness. Sweet and sticky. Surprisingly better than the ones I had 2 years ago from the same batch."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 31)",4.9,"Well, the hype is real.
Trying to put away the external factors when tasting/evaluating this beer is difficult, because they are an integral part of the experience. Its relative exclusivity, the confirmation bias that comes with the huge undertaking of buying this beer at the abbey, the feel of the place, the low-key bottle (oh, how I love the unblemished trappist bottle where the cap holds all the information), the crate and last but not least, the ratings and reviews - the hype.
 
The appearance is immaculate. The color of the beer and the look and feel of the foam are just... right. In the Westvleteren glass it looks almost understated, yet oh so inviting. 
The smell is understated too, maybe a tad too much, as when I first smelled it my stomach wrenched in worry that it would not deliver as promised. 

Well, it does deliver. It really, really does. 
Trying to describe the taste in detail is a bit meaningless for me, it is too complex. It has many of the tastes you expect from a dark trappist, dark fruits, nuts and all that other nonsense which I am not good at describing, but what sets this one apart from the rest of the trappists, and other belgian triples and quadruples for that matter, is a taste I can best describe as a soft bitterness. But its not really soft either, its there, and it fits so ... again, right. It gives the beer a dimension I have not experienced in other of its kind.

Either way. I realize I could never shake off my aforementioned confirmation bias, but hopefully the description of my experience could convince you to try it, as the hype is most definitely real."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 32)",5,"Superbe couleur ambrée sombre nez assez alcooleux puis en bouche, c'est toffee et massepain, c'est rond et c'est délicieux pourtant à l'origine je n'apprécie pas ce type de bière mais là c'est très bon !!!"
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 33)",4,"I was expecting more of an aroma, as I feel it's not a particularly intense one. Still quite good anyway, with notes of dried fruit, marzipan, toffee, licorice and liquor. Pours dark brown with a nice, thick, light beige head. Taste is mostly sweet and fills your mouth. Slightly too carbonated in my opinion, but it's still a nice mouthfeel, neither too thick nor too watery. Aftertaste is pretty intense, boozy, with a sweetness that lingers for a while. Pairs well with dried fruit, nuts and chocolate. While I do think it's a very good beer, I also feel like it's not THAT good and it's fame is due mostly to how difficult it used to be to find a bottle (I don't think that's the case anymore). That aside and based only on the quality of the beer, the price I payed is not justified, but as a one time occasion I guess it's worth it."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 34)",4.3,"A special beer for a special occasion. Drank it on my birthday with my friends alongside some hard old cheese, nice combination.
The beer itself is hard to taste without having in mind that it's supposed to be one of the best beers in the world. It's good for sure, but I don't know if it's the best I've ever had. To sum it up. Looks great, smells OK, tastes great."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 35)",4.5,"Dark brown colour with hazy and a bit brownish yellow foam on top.  Great wooden smell. Surprising contrast in your mouth. Great bitterness on the tongue that comes from 10,2 abv and on the other hand strong sweetness. Really strong beer."

Westvleteren 12,"(2, 40)",5,"Aroma is mixed fruits, somewhat sweet. Taste is absolutely incredible. An explosion of complex fruits and flavors. Quite expensive bottle but absolutely worth it (18€). Westvleteren X12 and Rochefort 10 are both in a tie in my opinion. two of my all time favorites."

Westvleteren 12,"(2, 68)",3.8,"Considered the best beer in the world. Tourists are being ripped off for a six pack at major cities. But the truth is that, personally, there are much better beers at the moment. Being the 12 the best of all 3, like any other gem, when too many people start to want the same gem, it looses quality. Right next to the abbey where it’s being made, u can sit down at taste it. I remember going there 3 years ago and it tasted like heaven. Nowadays it’s just crowded and the taste isn’t the same.
I am no specialist but there has to be more cO2 on it than before. I mean, after one beer, I’m bloated. Same as with Duvel, but a lot of people love Duvel.
A great beer? Yes, but not the greatest. I can name 10 beers in 5 seconds that are better, and not only Trappist."

Meget smag, mange aromaer.
Dyb og komplex 
Let bitter men stadig sød"
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 70)",4.2,"Not really a style I prefer, but is this a real good quad. Aroma is dark fruits, sweetish, phenolic. Flavor is burstig with dark fruits, molasses and a slight hint of roastiness. Highly sweet with moderate bitterness. Moderate body. A lot of Belgian yeast byproducts in the flavor; something I don't always like in combination with high sweetness and deep dark flavors. Defenitly a top tier quad, but I had some other quads before, that I personally found more enjoyable (and cheaper lol). Maybe I drank this one too young?"
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 71)",5,The best Quadrupel without any doubt! Only Quad that comes near to this is Rochefort 10!
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 72)",4.3,"An excellent quad, not as good as Rochefort 10 for my taste buds, but a close second nonetheless. The slightly bitter aftertaste is what puts me off a little, maybe I just need to age it 2-3 years."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 73)",5,"Still my favourite beer to date. I was skeptical prior to tasting as I knew of the massive hype behind this beer but I really do understand where it's coming from. Nothing to fault - super easy, very well balanced and has the delicious flavours you'd expect from a world class Abbey Quad. There is never a time where it wouldn't go down a treat!"
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 74)",4.8,"Great way to end a night.   We had a little beer tasting, sat back with the stragglers and opened this up.   Great little sipper to keep the night going a little longer."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 75)",5,"Unbelievable. Pours lovely with the famous ""rocky head"". Aroma is grand with lovely yeast and a promising multitude of flavours. Taste is also unbelievably multi-dimensional with all sorts of chocolate, caramel, dark fruit and roasted shades. There is no discussion about points and ranking. The questions is, why commercial brewers that produce accessible beers can't produce something like that?"
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 76)",4.9,"Bottle from brewery. So yeah, it really is the best beer in the world. Point proven."

W smaku poezja. Jest słodko, owocowo. Jak w aromacie i brzoskwinia. Rodzynki, akcenty biszkoptowe. Aksamitne toffi. Coś jak melasa, miód.
W posmaku goryczka typu skórka od brzoskwini. Na końcu spore rozgrzewanie. Trudno opisać poszczególne elementy, bo piwo jest bardzo kompleksowe, całościowe. Najlepszy belg jakiego piłem."

Westvleteren 12,"(2, 80)",4.4,"This one was four years old. 
It pour very dark brown color with medium lasting medium sized off white head. It has strong lacing. Aroma is very complex, it smells strongly of molasses, dark bread, raisin and berry like fruits. One of the most complex taste ever! Taste is moderately high sweet and subtle bitter, malt-hop balance tilts toward malt. You can realize different flavors in every sip. Raisin, molasses, licorice, fig, toffee and berry like frutiness... there is a perfect combination of many flavors. Finish is dry and strongly spicy. Great belgian yeast character! Very full bodied and it has moderate carbonation. Abv is well hidden and %10 abv is undetectable. And the best part, this is very easy to drink. Not my favorite beer of all time due to high sweetness, but it really deserves its fame and respect. Great beer. As I always say monks know beer!"

Rewelacyjne."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 84)",5,"Long have I waited to try Westvleteren 12.  I purchased a 33 cl bottle two years ago while on a trip to Amsterdam, thanks De Bierkoning. It has been put away for a momentous event.  That event was yesterday and today I celebrate.  I use my Trappistes Rochefort glass and pour most of the bottle to see a deep rich brown body with amber highlights.  The head is a steady, creamy looking, eggshell brown.  The scent is delightful, dark plum, bread, toffee, brown sugar.  And now finally, ultimately, I have a drink.  It was worth the wait.  Dark raisin, fig, malt, sourdough bread.  A bit of sweetness that goes to a nice  finishing bitterness.  Dense, chewy. It warms up, it gets more flavorful. My oh my. Better than Chimay Blue which had been my top rated beer of all.  The king is dead, long live the king.  Now it is time to fire up some Nirvana and finish the bottle. A great day, all in all."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 85)",4,"Butelka 0,33. 

I to jest ten słynny Westvleteren XII? No to przehajpowane piwo po całości. Owszem, dobre, ułożone, zbalansowane jak mało który quad, ale nie wyrywa z butów. Aromat: suszone figi, daktyle, rodzynki, lekko smażone banany. Smak: słodkie na chwilę, dalej wytrawne, eteryczne, lekko mulące, mocno wysycone. Posmak nie pozostawia żadnych nieprzyjemności w ustach i na języku. Najwyższa jakość, ale doznania smakowe jak wiele innych piw trapistów."

Westvleteren 12,"(2, 90)",4.1,"Bottle. Aroma- clear dried fruits, figs, raisins, also candid red fruits and maybe subtle caramel in the background- very pleasant composition. Dark copper, clear, with a medium, good-looking, beige head and a great lacing. Taste- intensive, rich fruity notes. Quite dry, with medium-low, herbal bitterness in the aftertaste, which counters very well the fruitiness. Medium-bodied, with a medium carbonation. Distinct, very solid Belgian beer, but all in all, it doesn't blow off my mind."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 91)",4,"Has a great smoothness to it that makes it so drinkable, for such a big body beer it comes out quite dry in the end. The dark belgian raisin, and super dark subtle cherry notes are perfect for the style. Dark, rich, and complex. Great beer. Belgian beer factory online bottle expiry date in 2.5 years."

Westvleteren 12,"(2, 94)",4.7,"Ik heb een paar 33cl flesjes bemachtigd. Mooie bruine kleur, het crèmekleurige schuim blijft niet lang liggen. Ruikt sterk naar alcohol net als andere quadruppels. Erg veel smaken, in het begin een beetje bitter, met tonen van hout, koffie en karamel. Daarna fruitig en zoetig. Ik snap de hype, het bier is niet in massaproductie en de exclusiviteit maakt het bier stiekem iets lekkerder."
Westvleteren 12,"(2, 95)",3.9,"330ml bottle courtesy from Johan and his dad!! Cheers to you both as I have been waiting a long time to taste this iconic quad. Sampled on the 10th February 2019, poured into a tulip glass. Slightly opaque dark russet with a thick pale buff head. Strong malty aroma with notes of warm bread along with sweet dark fruit notes of figs and plum. Thick mouthfeel with slight effervescence on the tongue. Good lacing throughout. Complex malt delivers a rich Christmas cake base with strong fruit notes of syrupy dates, raisins, damsons, prunes with barley sugar twist. Earthy, damp note to the subtle hop content delivers a short but balanced flavour to the aftertaste. Finish is malty with Cognac booze notes not overwhelming the malt character but you know the strength is there. Candied fruit notes still continue along with golden syrup, but dates and raisins are the main driver here. An excellent Trappist Quad and well worth the hyperbole! Another ticked off the bucket list."

Fajna goryczka z przyprawowym i pieprznym finiszem. Dużo ciała, słodkie i wyklejające. Niesamowicie dobre piwo w smaku zaczyna się magia. Doskonałe piwo chociaż myślę że hype na nie jest mocno przesadzony. Czy warto bez dwóch zdań tak, ale trzeba podejść do niego bez emocji i wtedy mamy po prostu dobrego quada a nie boską ambrozję :)"

Nektar Ken Schramm Signature Series - The Heart of Darkness,"(1, 28)",4.7,"Colorado mead tasting 2012 - viscous pour - dark reddish purple - the nose is unreal - bursting with currant and black cherry aromas - sweet, but with a lovely earthiness and tartness to balance - loads of fruit skin tannins - I could smell this all night - smooth, silky mouthfeel - wow - just wow - ineffably good - words will not do this justice - the fruit adds both depth of sweetness and a balancing acidity - cherry adds the sweetness while the currants add the tartness - tart and quite vinous through the middle - finish is all raspberry - just...dude - this is the mead to end all meads - the end."

Dark reddish purple pour with no head, aroma is big notes of sweet raspberry, blackberry, cherry, some hints of rhubarb, a nice slight dry note from the rhubarb, hints of a vanilla in there.

Pours a darkish brown/black...looks like a port. Nose is berries, vinous character, and light chocolate sweetness. Taste is similar, just has a richer sweetness to it...the berries are just amazing. Rich, smooth alcohol, delish.



Yeah, this bottle is $$$ but damn it’s so good. Wow, gonna be hard to stay away from my bottle.

B. Nektar Ken Schramm Signature Series - The Heart of Darkness,"(1, 33)",4.7,"2011 bottle split with Allen and Joe. This one was pricey as shit but WOW, what a treat. Deep and full ruby purple pour with bright purple bubbled light head, not much lacing. Aromas of welsch grape juice, currants, finest pinot noir around, raspberries, cherries, dark grape skins, and light wood. Taste is loaded with berries upon berries. Tons of insanely tart morello cherries, and raspberry puree.This mead never got old, luscious and delicate flavors and scents working in perfect harmony. Had a good bit of raspberry tart quality from NG to it but way more compex with a touch of floral honey and a boost from the cherries. Medium to full bodied mead. I would say that the price was a little high, but split three ways it was well worth it. Cheers Ken."

Pours a still, dark ruby red. Nose is full of berry patch and floral honey. The taste is incredibly fruit forward with lingering notes of sweet blackberries, raspberries, cherries & a bit of blueberry. It has a long, sweet finish and somewhat syrupy, but perfect for dessert. Super decadent and full of rich honey soaked berry notes. A very special mead without a doubt, but a bottle could easily be shared amongst a large group of friends."

B. Nektar Ken Schramm Signature Series - The Heart of Darkness,"(1, 39)",4.4,"Tried a sample at B. Nektar.  Glad I did.  Poured a blood red, as mentioned in previous ratings.  Really dark and foreboding.  Looked quite thick in the glass, and like a serious drink.  Aroma is huge, Super ripe cherry hits me first, maybe one of the best cherry aromas I have ever smelled, I pictured dark black cherries, you definitely get currants and berries as well and some sweet dark  honey.  Taste delivers on the aroma huge cherry again, quite a bit of tartness as well from the berries, like a raspberry tartness, tons and tons of red fruit, there is just so much fruit in this thing, on the back end you remember that this is a mead, as the big dark sweet honey kicks in to balance some of the fruit tartness, long finish and a residual sweetness in the back of you mouth, as the tart berries settles on your tongue.  At some point you forget exactly what you are drinking and that there is alcohol involved, as the drink is so interesting and fun.  Serious stuff, is it worth $100, who knows, but it feels like no expense was spared when you drink it.  Really glad to have tried it."

The aroma is full and rich with pungent earthy berry smelling dark currants as well as well nearly bright levels of crushed up fruit skin tartness and rich sweet ripe to mildly tart cherry meat. Wow! The taste is rich and vibrant with cherry meat nuanced earthy currant sweet nectar like goodness. Wow. I frikin’ love currant used in this way. Behind those rich succulent notes are cherry to currant tartness as well as firm currant earthiness pulling this all together. It ends dry and all the flavor withers away effortlessly."

The bouquet is a wealth of fruity, earthy, tannic black currants mingled with sweet raspberries, cherries and rich, dark honey. Full-bodied with a skim-milk mouthfeel. The flavor is very smooth, quite fruity, medium sweet and moderately tart, offering substantial essences of cherry and raspberry. Finishes tangy and fruity with a bold kiss of black currant tannins. Big-time thanks to biggsbowler for sharing this decadent rarity!"
B. Nektar Ken Schramm Signature Series - The Heart of Darkness,"(1, 42)",4.9,"Bottle - Thanks Dave - This is an amazing mead. First off, it is blood red in color and pours like blood coming from your hand into a glass. It really has that look and feel of blood. Taste was on another level. You can taste raspberries and cherries, but the black currants were the strongest flavor. Im not sure if it was the honey or something else, but I got a little bit of cinnamon in the mouth. Truly a great mead and I’ll say it was worth the price. B. Nektar and Ken Schramm, Thanks for making awesome meads."
B. Nektar Ken Schramm Signature Series - The Heart of Darkness,"(1, 43)",4.8,"Received full glass pour at the B. Nektar meadery in Ferndale, MI. Pours an opaque dark ""stop sign"" red, clean disk top and plenty of viscosity tears. Aroma of dark cherries, raspberry and a hint of currants. Flavor is almost syrupy, loaded with cherries and raspberries with sweet light flower honey. Finish is dessert-like sweet as I feel blood-rush sensation above my cheeks. More cherry flavor in the 2011 vintage as the 2009 vintage had more black currant. By far one of the best dessert meads I’ve encountered."

B. Nektar Ken Schramm Signature Series - The Heart of Darkness,"(1, 49)",4.3,"bottle # 24/110
Perfect fit for rating # 3000. A very special bottle indeed. First because it was offered to me as a present for my graduation by Greg, Askofficerfriendly and his wife. Second, a celebration of my bday and return to Belgium, and third, probably the first B.Nektar mead to make it to Europe and one of my favorite US meadery.
This one goes out to you Greg/Bridget and the good folks at B.Nektar!

Pours a deep burgundy with an outstanding clear syrupy filament/coating on the glass.
The aroma brings this mead to another level by the depth of the fruits being used. One can easily pick a medley of currants, raspberries and cherries where one scent leaves room to another never to overtake the experience.
Perfect bouquet of honey follows adding this ever enjoyable organic natural fragrance.
The mouthfeel is similar to the aroma and a bouquet of orchard brings fantastic dimensions to the mead. Great blend between the fruits leaving room for each cherry, raspberries and currants to be noticed.  The honey adds a great balance to the acidity of the fruits that although not overpowering was enough to give me a nice heartburn quickly following the first glass (a first with all B.Nektar) and that was the low point of the whole experience. The honey also leaves a mild sweet syrupy sticky finish on the lips that is very enjoyable.

Overall a great mead that I thoroughly enjoyed in good company of family."
B. Nektar Ken Schramm Signature Series - The Heart of Darkness,"(1, 50)",4.9,"This is a mead of fantastic quality.  The price and limited production makes it very rare.  I opened bottle #82 of 110. Retails for ($110) for 375ml.  the depth of fruit is amazing.  The cherry, raspberry black currant blend is truly a treat.  The cherry tastes phenominally fresh with wonderful notes of raspberry cutting through.  The currants provide great acidity.  I truly thank Ken Schramm for using his own fruit.  Propably on of the freshest products I have ever tasted.  The honey truly capture the essence of the fruit. If you are ever lucky enough to try the mead will clearly explain it’s self. Definitive mead."

Cigar City Pilot Series Dragonfruit Passion Fruit Berliner Weisse,"(1, 9)",4.1,"Draft at Cigar City during Hunahpu Day 2012. 

Pours a dark blood/beet red color that’s almost purple with a one finger pink foam head that quickly settles into a thin ring.  Minimal lacing left behind.  Definitely a unique looking beer.  Don’t see many that have that color.

The aroma is bursting with sweet tropical fruit.  I’m not very familiar with either of these fruits but the tropical fruit presence dominates the nose.  Slightly seedy with a decent amount of funk but the aroma is all about the dragonfruit/passionfruit.  Could use a bit more funk/traditional berlinerweisse character but still smells really good.

Medium bodied with a nice balance of tart funkiness and sweet tropical fruit.  More balanced than the nose suggests with some lactic funk, acidity and bready yeast but it’s still dominated by sweet, juicy fruit notes.  Very sweet but with enough acidity and funk to keep it from becoming one dimensional.  Very refreshing with a crisp dry finish.  A lot of people went apeshit over this beer and while I think that’s it’s really good, it didn’t completely blow me away.  I  actually preferred the Miami Madness over this one."

S - Huge fruity tart bomb. It’s really hard to type down how good the nose on this one was. Nice level of tartness, sweet tropical fruits...doesn’t need more then that. The fresh fruits and natural notes are what makes it awesome. Doesn’t smell ""fake"" like many other fruit-inspired beers I’ve ticked. 

T - Again, huge exotic fruits, sweet smoothie-esk fruit sweetness, nice level of tart/sour that works perfectly together. The natural freshness of this beer is what makes it special. It’s like I went and picked the fruits out that morning and created this beer. Amazing. 

M - Light, crisp and refreshing, light carbonation, dry finish.

OK the aroma, it is simply bold and big and runs toward crazy beyond belief. I get crumbly blue cheese, bloated bird feces, soiled and molding old diapers, earthy rotting fruit, fresh vomit rimmed with bile, vinegar, body odor and revolting to the point you’re not sure you want to go on. Well, the oddness and depth and intrigue and it’s this whole aroma put together that smells very intriguing thus it pulls you forward.

Cigar City Pilot Series Dragonfruit Passion Fruit Berliner Weisse,"(1, 39)",4.8,"A: Poured an electric color of magenta, sorta the bright color of pink that kids create by putting a highlighter in water to spice up liquor bottles in a dorm room. Small fizzy head with no retention. The sight of the beer alone sent people to the tap in droves. S: The aroma was bold and citric. Fresh fruity undertones with hints of acidic sharpness. T: The color may have sent people running it was the flavor that brought them back. The beer was awesome simply put. Nice sharp tartness right up front. Slighty citric, my guess this was provided by the dragon fruit After the initial blast of tartness it actually smooths out real nicely. A nice mild sweetness comes through almost guava like which I will attribute to the passion fruit. A Yin and Yang of a beer, tart, sweet, awesome, and stunningly beautiful. M: Medium in body starts tart finishes sweeter with only a mild acidic character. D: Awesome. It is one I would have revisited all day.

Taste was serious business dragon fruit/passion fruit and yes strawberry jolly ranchers was a great description. It made me smack my chops three or four times after each sip and it made my mouth water for more.  The Tartness was spot on as it didn’t over power but caught you right at the tip of the tongue then made way for all the fruity goodness.

Great work J-Dub!!"
Cigar City Pilot Series Dragonfruit Passion Fruit Berliner Weisse,"(1, 41)",4.4,"on tap at Hunahpu 2011.  Poured a velvet light red color with a pinkish type head.  Aroma was tons of berries, passion fruit, sweet tarts, and jolly ranchers.  Flavor was so mouth puckering dry that it made my face turn sideways and yell ""that’s slap yo mamma sour.""  The flavors were just so amazing that I couldn’t believe the blends of fruit in this thing.  Raspberry, passion fruit, red berries, tropical fruit, and on and on.....This was easily one of the best beers on the day."
Cigar City Pilot Series Dragonfruit Passion Fruit Berliner Weisse,"(1, 42)",4.6,"On tap at Hunah 2011! This beer was, hands down, one of the days major show-stealers. The minute the beer is poured into the glass, your  attention is brought into focus, the color is a translucent blood-ruby with a pink ""weisse"" head. The aroma is a sweet fruit  pungency and tartness, nose-full of passion fruit and some hints of the dragon fruit follows suit.  Palate starts with some tart passion fruit which quickly leads into the traditional, berliner weisse refreshing wheat tartness. Sweet fruit melds into the background and the backpalate is then left with a clean citrus finish. Excellent beer!"
Cigar City Pilot Series Dragonfruit Passion Fruit Berliner Weisse,"(1, 43)",4.1,"Tap at Hunahpu 2011. Everyone was carrying around the festival something that looked like Kool-aid burst so I decided to find out what it was. Lo and behold, Dragon Passionfruit Berliner Weisse. The pour is a hilariously deep, clear pink with a nice, fizzy pink head. Looks like a fruit juice spritzer. Aroma is heavy seedy raspberries, odd phenol character. Taste is heavy berry tannic, fully tart like a passionfruit smoothie. Some people at the festival claimed it wasn’t very tart, which is incorrect. Very refreshing and nicely done. Definitely something to pursue for the normal CCB lineup- bound to be the most loved beer in the world by women in their 20s. If you want more girls getting into good beer, this is the winning ticket. 3/14/2011 7/4/7/4/14=3.6

Tap at Berliner Bash thanks to JW77. Gorgeous purple pink pour. Full haze. Creamy and glowing. Whoa. Nose is super intense rhubarb/strawberry, dragonfruit, fresh mango. Taste is very nice- super seedy, sharp and zippy, loads of acid, small wheat beer graininess remains. Very nice. Heavy citric acid. Zippy, lactic yogurty palate. Delicious though I like the Rhubarb Pie and Miami Madness a lot more. 5/18/2012 8/5/8/4/16=4.1"

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"(1, 13)",4.4,"650 mL bottle. Originally reviewed 3/3/2012.
Inky black and viscous looking. A vigorous pour yields only a slight chocolate head. No retention to speak of.

Smells wonderful. Bourbon, but so well integrated. It’s not a bourbon bomb like regular BCBS. Vanilla and oak blend seamlessly with the chocolate stout flavors. Far less boozy than regular BCBS. Even less boozy than Big John.

Initial tingly bourbon flavor followed by vanilla and caramel malts. The flavor fades to a darker malt roast of chocolate and coffee. Very sweet, but almost forgivable given the flavors at play. The sweetness gives it a slightly fruity flavor that complements the roast nicely. Like chocolate covered cherries.

Regular BCBS tastes like it’s 20% alcohol. This tastes nowhere near 13%. It’s amazing how dramatically it changes the beer. Still immensely sweet and a slow drink. Thick, viscous, and low in carbonation.

It’s a really good stout. Much better than BCBS. Worth the money? Probably not.

Update: Drank my last bottle on 10/3/2016 side-by-side with 2015 Rare and there was no comparison. 2010 was still drinking great and was a far better beer than 2010."

Wow this is good, ridiculous. The thing that kept the regular one from reaching perfection was that it was a small touch too boozy, this one isn’t, it has more elegance, more nuances. Not sure if age is the reason here, I have never had the regular one 5 years old or whether this beer had these qualities back when it was young. Either way, this is close to 5 with a bigger pour I might have upped it to a 5.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"(1, 28)",4.4,"Bottle #1448

Pours viscous, pitch black and completely opaque with a half finger mocha head that immediately disappears. No lacing left behind but it does have lasting legs that coat the glass in a muddy film. 

Barrel character is really strong in the nose but it seems nicely integrated into aroma. Lots of spicy bourbon but it’s not overpowering with dry oak, toasted coconut and vanilla bean notes. Sweet, slightly roasted malt backbone with sweet and dark chocolate, molasses, coffee bean, baker’s chocolate and subtle roast/burnt malt. 

On the fuller end of medium bodied with subtle viscosity and an excellent barrel character that’s perfectly integrated into the base beer. Spicy bourbon barrel with toasted coconut, marshmallow, vanilla and a wonderful spicy PVW flavor. Subtle boozy heat but not fiery, harsh or overpowering. Tastes just like the spirit without obliterating the base beer. Sure, there’s some sweet booze and heat lingering throughout but the other barrel notes and malt backbone counter things nicely. Fudge-y chocolate goodness with fudge, caramel, molasses and toffee give it a sweet and dessert like quality but it’s not one-note. There’s some roast with hints of dark chocolate, roasted gourmet coffee bean, burnt toast and oatmeal. The high ABV is extremely well masked making this delicious, complex beer dangerously drinkable. The flavor of this beer is close to perfect."
Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"(1, 29)",4.8,"From notes. Shared at a BCBS tasting put on by Brian Winters. Thanks! I didn’t get the bottle number on this baby, but oh man. The pour is a thick, viscous, oily black with a medium brown collar of head. The aroma is phenomenal. Heavy roasted malts and chocolate to go along with a wonderful bourbon complexity. This is probably the best smelling bourbon barrel character I’ve ever picked up in a beer. There is a lot of dark fruit and a little toffee in there. The flavors mimic it as well. The only thing that pails is there is a light lack of vanilla in the aroma. This is detectable in the flavor, and I love it. The malts and dark fruits are killer, and there is just a great bourbon presence. The mouth feel is viscous and chewy with a soft carbonation and a lingeringly boozy, caramel, malty finish.

Plush mouthfeel, almost creamy. Bourbon, dried figs, vanilla, touch of coffee and dark malts. Terrific balance, not hot at all, super smooth and velvety.

Bottle hand numbered 4,554 with a hand written bottle date of 11/19/2010, poured into a Firestone Walker Barrelworks Teku glass on 3/15/14. Pours viscous black with a half finger of dark brown head. Aroma is big vanilla, chocolate, bourbon, coconut, wood, graham crackers, toffee, caramel. Kind of smells like vanilla bourbon rolos. Pretty awesome. Flavor is so smooth with chocolate bourbon, graham crackers, vanilla, coconut, caramel, oak. Finish is long with strong notes of vanilla, coconut, graham crackers, and caramel. Viscous and lucious mouthfeel, low medium carbonation. Extremely smooth and while the bourbon notes are there, this isn't super boozy at all. Just awesome. The main difference I see with this relative to regular BCS is the heightened coconut and graham cracker flavors. Definitely lives up to the hype, but not sure there's a reason to seek this out again when I can find BCS each year for much less. With that said, so glad I tried it once. A world class beer that deserves its reputation."

Deep, sludgy black with barely any head, only a flimsy, slowly rising, deep-mocha skin that grazes the top. Amazing aroma of dark fudge, smooth warming bourbon & oak, roasted malts & barley, decadent chocolate & vanilla drizzle, scorched brown sugar... Both boozy & sweet but so well refined. Taste is full-out chocolate up front; dark cocoa nibs, rich fudge, moist chocolate cake wrapped in brown sugar, dipped in bourbon, drizzled with vanilla, then served on wet oak. The background holds more intricate notes of molasses, bruised dates & prunes, light mallow, roasted malt, & barrel-induced coconut. Very low carbonation, huge palate presence, coating your mouth with bourbon, fudge cake, & brown sugar. Sweet, boozy, but executed admirably. This is like a polished version of BCS... Mike & I did a side-by-side with a 2012 BCS & both agreed that Rare was much more mellow & well integrated. However, I’ve had both 2008 & 2009 bottles of BCS, aged appropriately, that were nearly this good & equally as refined. Is this a great barrel aged stout? Absolutely. Is it worth the price increase or difficulty to acquire as compared to regular BCS? Probably not completely."

The bourbon character is a thing of beauty with layers of flavors similar to the nose the fruit forward almost apple brandy roundness compliments the deep rich chocolate and melds into a slow meandering sweetness that is accentuated by the bourbon heat and there is a layer of spiciness to the barrel character that is pretty distinct.

Doft av vanilj, bourbon och nostalgi. Känner att den troligen inte har att vinna på längre lagring. Balanserad, len och fin. Svag känsla av oxidation som är lätt att bortse från och bara njuta och känna sig nostalgisk och minnas tillbaka till sin första bourbonfatade imperial stout."

Great slick, oily texture that just slides down the muzzle. Bourbon flavor is real smooth leaning on subdued. I would say if you have any of this now is the time to drink it. Still wonderful flavor but I feel like it is leaning on the ledge of falling off real soon. I was really happy to have gotten to sample this.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"(1, 90)",4.5,"Bottle #11755

Opened with an ’08 next to it (courtesy of Rob, thanks dude!) It is amazing to compare side by side what the barrel and time did in this beer.

Opened on a Wednesday, just because. Pours a nice dark leather with no discernable carbonation - which suits this beer. When I dive into the beer I experience a nose only similar to on other beer I’ve had - ORF 2009. The Pappy 23 barrels DO actually impart a unique nose and it’s minerally, rich, dessert like and difficult for me to describe. Flavor follows and is quite rich. A really fine, nearly empty carbonation allows the medium on heavy beer to roll over the tongue slowly and results in a long finish. 

There are some things here that are interesting - no carb really, resulting in a less than desirable mouthfeel and appearance. That’s a standard feeling, but here I am making concessions, as the beer is still lovely and feels very, very nice. I don’t know if it was intentional, but these two characteristics match the personality of the beer outstandingly.

Huge aroma of molasses, coffee, bourbon, and you can feel the heat in the aroma from the alcohol. Ebony black with a tiny head. You cannot describe the taste in the space allotted here. Smokey sweet molasses coats your mouth, and then the other flavors melt through. Vanilla, choacolate, hints of bourbon, and bitter sweet chocolate. Finishes with a warming burn from the alcohol and the perfect amount of bitterness.  Notes of charcoal also, outstanding, worth the wait."

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"(1, 96)",4.6,"Tasted from a numbered bottle at Three Kings Public House during the Goose Island Migration Week St. Louis. It poured an opaque, nearly black color, reddish at the corners when held to the light, with thin but lasting tan foam, Belgian lace and alcoholic legs when swirled. Irresistibly rich bourbon barrel aromas: toasted hardwood, vanilla, buttery booze. Standard imperial stout characteristics too: caramel, brown bread, toast, roasted barley, dark chocolate, nuts, toffee, coffee and cream, plums and sour cherries, faint black pepper and bright acidity. Faintly tangy hops bitterness made it all the way through. Medium heavy body, full chewy mouthfeel, smooth alcoholic warmth. Exquisite multi-layered aftertastes: fruity, tart, toasty, bourbon-y. As with other versions of BCS, the syrupy thickness and dark tannins actually stained the glass. Insanely delicious. I didn’t think I’d ever get to try this sought-after beer. It’s seldom that something so hyped and highly anticipated actually IS as good as they say. This is undoubtedly one of those times. A near perfect beer."

A- The lowest carbonation of the bunch, essentially no head formation whatsoever upon pouring. Thick, blackest of black, motor oil appearance. 

S- Tons of barrel on the nose as well as bourbon. Some sweetness, almost like a port-like oxidation. In addition, some vanilla. 

T- Tons of vanilla, barrel and bourbon. The vanilla is very rich and the most apparent note. Tastes absolutely fantastic. 

M- Thick, rich, and lingering. Not much more to be said. Simply fantastic from start to finish. Minimal carb. 

O- We actually misidentified this as the ’09 bomber, and the ’09 bomber as this. To be honest, we all enjoyed the ’09 more, although this was the close second out of our ratings by just 1 or 2 total points. We should have been able to guess by the very low levels of carbonation.

A - Pours pitch black, not quite as oily as I thought it would be, minimal head with almost no lacing. Appeared mostly flat



S - Licorice, Vanilla, Plums, Coconut and charred oak were the biggest notes. Smell was something bigger though, something I couldn’t quite place my finger on but it smells fantastic.



T - Very little sweetness, Lots of flavors going on, very big but yet well integrated bourbon notes. After drinking a lot of Pappy and other wheated bourbons lately, this tastes just like Pappy 20 at least as far as the bourbon notes go. Not too oaky, loaded with vanilla, some plums, brown sugar, candy corns, not too sweet at the finish and NOT boozy. 



M - Oily, slick and heavy. Not fudge-like or thick but smooth and just a bit thinner than ’10 BCBS in a 12oz format



O - It’s amazing how drinking half of this bomber was so easy not because it was tasteless but because it was so refined and not boozy at all. BCBS Rare is not the king any more though. There are a lot of great beers that have taken it’s place but, for a 2010 stout, it’s fantastic and lovely. Really something special."
Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"(2, 26)",4.5,"Bottle 5901 -- Opaque beer with a this wisp of tiny bubbles for a head. Magical nose of wood, bourbon, vanilla and roasted malts. This is one of those beers that I could just smell for half an hour. Huge taste of chocolate, cocoa nibs, bourbon, vanilla, plum, raisin and prune, wood and alcohol. Sweet and sticky on the lips. So rich and so good."
Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"(2, 27)",4.8,"Bottle 6,073. Finally pulled this one out of the cellar. A- heavy black pour but not as viscous as I would have expected. Very minimal dark tan head and absent any real lacing. S- loud grains and toasted malts first. Bourbon, licorice, cacao follow. Baked pie crust, dates, chocolate covered raisins, rich vanilla, toffee, peanut brittle, jiffy puff marshmallows, brown sugar, maple syrup and a vanilla creme brÃ»lÃ©e. Some faint earthiness. As it warms, alcohol begins to overpower. Just a symphony of aromas. M- a medium to heavy body for such a beer, with a dry, full palate and a mild but efficient stinging carbonation. T- bourbon, vanilla, toasted marshmallow and a tangy cacao to start. Alcohol, grains, graham cracker crust, pancakes and delectable maple syrup are next. Charred oak, licorice, brown sugar, chocolate and dates fill the middle. The entire taste flows from one period to the next with the long mild ending, consisting of more grain, brown sugar, sweet malts, toasted sesame seeds, and tangy cacao, continuing the trend of smoothness. 9/9+"

Taste is very similar to the standard bourbon county.  Not on the bourbon as the ’12 i had the other night.  I guess the real difference is that this is much smoother, possibly the smoothest bourbon stout ive tried.  However, the beer had zero carbonation.  Not sure if it was due to the age or the keg.  Overall ths was a very fine bourbon stout, just doesnt have much to seperate it from the regular bourbon county or justify the insane price it commands on the secondary market."

Exquisite, but a tiny bit too much for me."

Appearance wise it is identical to BCBS, no surprise there. Having never had the 2008 vintage which this beer is using, I can say its awfully similar to how the 2009 vintage is drinking now. There is a stronger vanilla presence and it is smoother and mellower than the standard beer. Just loads of chocolate, charred malt, and rich and decadent bourbon. It drinks far too easily, which is sad considering how elusive it is now. A marginal improvement over standard BCBS, but when that is your favorite beer it truly does matter. Such a beautiful beer that I’m glad to have finally tried."

Enjoyed Rare at a Beer Tasting with some local beer snobs in Feb.

I knew this was going to be a fabulous tick, but man, I had no idea it would be so good!!

Aroma: Vanilla and bourbon.

Taste: Sweetness from vanilla and bourbon plus the strength of the alcohol
Palate: Full body and smooth texture. Finish stayed well after each taste
Overall: Unbelievable!! So glad to have such good friends who share such great beers like Rare."
Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"(2, 40)",4.2,"Pours thick and dark unclear black without much of a head. Aroma brings smooth bourbon and some nutty malts with a hint of vanilla. Flavor is so smooth, especially next to a bunch of different years of BCS. The flavor brings sweet and roasted malts and then smooth sweet and boozy bourbon shortly thereafter to settle so nicely on the palate. The smoothness of the beer is the incredulous part, not a richness you might expect, it is barrel aged, and Pappy brings the rare smoothness."

Pours black as night with a thin, tan head that quickly dissipates into a ring around the glass. There’s not as much bourbon in the nose as I’d expected, but it’s definitely there, mixed with sweet vanilla, dark chocolate, and molasses notes. Taste is boozy upfront, but not over-powering. Bourbon, roasty, chocolatey, sweet vanilla notes. Full bodied and rich texture, low-to-medium carbonation. Perfect blend of bite and smoothness. Overall, this beer was great right when it was released. Two years in the cellar really rounded it out into a damn-near perfect beer. Each sip was better than the last, and when it finally got down to the last few drops, I didn’t want it to end. That’s the definition of a great beer, and Goose Island nailed it. This is the best barrel-aged stout I’ve had or ever will have, probably."

Flavor is hot bourbon up front with some chocolate sweetness and roasty bitterness, also some vanilla and coconut barrel taste. Full body with mild carbonation and a creamy thick mouth feel. I love this beer but it’s so similar to the regular version, still lots of bourbon/alcohol heat after a few years and showing no signs of age."

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"(2, 54)",4.8,"Review #400

Pulled this guy out of the cellar. Bottle #574 split with friends at my engagement party. Bottled 11/19/2010. 22 oz. bottle served in a Deschutes tulip.

A: Pours a pitch black color with a dark wood head forming on the pour. It recedes quickly to a thin ring and leaves some splotchy and sticky lace down the glass.

S: Wonderful sweet bourbon, roasted malts and dark fruits are harmoniously all wafting out of the glass. Some light oak and chocolate come up as the beer warms. It’s a very smooth and delicious smell.

T: Just simply divine. Deliciously smooth bourbon, this Pappy 23 is so smooth and sweet. Nice dark fruit malts with a little dried, salted plum flavor. A nice mix of savory and sweet. Once the bourbon flavors die down a little the actual barrel comes out with nice mild, woody oak and a bit of char. Sweet caramel and smooth vanilla. Nice brownie flavors with some bittersweet chocolate and great roasted malts.

M: Smooth and creamy with medium to low carbonation, but it is a tad thin even for a barrel aged beer. I would have liked a bit more chew, but it just goes down so smooth with a mild warmth it’s really a nitpicking complaint.

O: Basically perfect. There is no overt alcohol flavors that are offputting, just the deliciously smooth and sweet PVW barrel. Decadent flavors with an awesome combination of sweet and savory this is a must try for any stout fan. It was my only one, but I couldn’t imagine sharing it with anyone but my friends on a really special occasion. Hopefully I can try this beauty again some day!

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"(2, 55)",4.9,"As good as advertised.  From notes at BBL Stout tasting in Centennial CO. Tons of vanilla and coconut bourbon notes in the nose with sweet molasses and toffee.  Taste is much like the nose, very well integrated notes of caramel, vanilla, boozy bourbon and oak play with the fudge-y base beer.  Thick and chewy, coats the mouth.  Amazing beer, the best of the night and one of the best I’ve ever had."

Thick brown sticky that lends black oil leaking down through the dense bubbles. Nose is intense and complex - cherries, sweet pleasant vanilla, mellow bourbon, caramel complexities, oaky, raisins, dried dates, and pleasant rich bourbon.  Flavor lends smooth bourbon, cherries, vanilla, mellow bourbons.  Smooth, rich, and oily.  Viscous.  Wonderful.  We had this with the 2009 regular and 2010 Vanilla and Rare was a huge standout."

The appearance is a beautiful jet black with a high viscosity and a perfect deep brown head. The Pappy Van Winkle Barrels pour out in the nose. Loads of oak, maple syrup, coffee and chocolate tones as well. The bourbon is also very forward in the flavors. There is a distinct heat to the mouth but the smoothness and density of flavors completely distracts you from it. Great roasted malts, rich oak, chocolate, maple syrup, light doses of black licorice, vanilla, and more. The flavors and nose just keep giving and giving. Wonderfully full mouth.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"(2, 63)",4.8,"Thanks to Forgetfu for the bottle. Much appreciated
Bottle #7566 poured into a Great Divide tulip

A-- Opened bottle and a white fume of smoke came billowing out of the bottle. Very nice. Poured motor oil black, small dark brown/ dark mocha colored head that quickly dies off, leaving a dark mocha colored ring around the sides. A little bit of head retention but it is more of a rebuilding of the film. 

S-- Where to begin? Oak, bourbon, stewed vanilla beans, and dark fruits. Layers and layers of flavors in the nose. The ABV is evident in the nose but much more restrained than what BCS Vanilla and regular BCS are like in the nose to me. Nowhere near as sweet smelling has Vanilla was. Very well balanced. 

T-- Wow. All I can say is wow. Bourbon, vanilla, Carmel, chocolate and oak. So soft and creamy. Not very sweet at all. Utterly shocked by this as I hated BCS Vanilla due to the sweetness. Once again the word is balanced. 

M-- Slick and slightly oily. Not that thick but man this is smooth stuff. A bit of an oaked vanilla finish to this. Slight bits of tannins and alcohol to the gums just adds a excellent punch to this. Slight bits of alcohol burn. Utterly Sublime. 

O-- Had been very weary as was not a fan of Vanilla and BCS. This is just insane good. Alcohol is well hidden and this is easy to drink. Takes port to a new level. Honestly an insane good beer. All I really can say is this is mind blowing good. Worthy of the hype and the love this has been given."

Instead of going into detail on each component of this beer’s characteristics I just want to say that the smoothness of this brew paired with the subtle and well balanced flavors make this one a winner. Very creamy and rich. The bourbon notes in the aroma and taste are so complimentary and intoxicating that they truly make this beer a rare gem. I think this brew is so good due to the fact that the bourbon and beer have come together as one and make something brand new if that makes any sense. It’s damn good, nut much else to say."

Great barrel influence, just a rich complex sweetness and rustic oakiness with very little coconut (which I can’t stand).

Flavour is incredibly complex, rich, deep, decadent... wow. Perhaps never tasted a BA-stout so complex and so finely affected by the barrels. Listing off flavours won’t do this justice, but it contains uber-complex bourbon barrels, light vanilla, molasses and a quite noticeable alcohol sting - slightly more so than the regular BCS.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"(2, 81)",4.8,"Shared at a tasting I recently hosted. Served alongside a vertical of Bourbon County Brand Stout 2003, 2005-10, BCBS Vanilla, BCBS Coffee, and Night Stalker.

Bottle #1,430

A: The beer has a pitch black appearance. The stout is completely opaque with a thin beige head atop the beer. The head recedes after a few short moments, leaving only faint traces of lacing on the glass.

S: The aroma is huge, with the obvious scents of bourbon, roast, and oak.

T: The flavor is fantastic. It was very interesting to taste the evolution of Bourbon County Brand Stout and all of the variants. The Rare version is recognizably smoother and softer on the palate than the regular offering. The bourbon aspect is up front, as one would expect, and melds beautifully with the roast and barrel notes. It seems as though the Pappy Van Winkle barrels make a substantial difference after all.

M: This beer excels in mouthfeel. Thick, rich, and viscous - this beer coats the palate with chocolate and warming alcohol. A very smooth ride, especially given the 13% ABV.

D: A delicious beer, but the $50 price tag is too steep. Great for sharing with your favorite drinking buddies."
Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"(2, 82)",4.5,"22oz bottle brought to a tasting by me, via trade from Tweety. In my cellar since 2010. Consumed 6-16, reviewed from notes.

A: I’m shocked. This is deep black. I great a really nice mocha head from my pour, though, and the legs stick to the glass. Perfect presentation.

N: We drank this after running through an 06-11 vertical, and the nose is definitely PvW. It has a deep oakiness which I’ve only experienced when drinking the bourbon straight. The caramel, vanilla, and coconut also have some extra heft. Chocolate, espresso. 

T: Dark fruits (prunes and raisins) Chocolate. Dismayed by the lack of roast/coffee. Caramel/vanilla. Some residual heat, but it’s gotten to the point of being a nice touch. 

M: Smooth, silky and viscous. 

O: This is really very good when viewed outside of the ridiculous value-inflation of the beer. However, I dare say I’d take the 2009 BCS and the BCS Vanilla over it. The PvW 23 is great to taste in the blend, and it is a deeper flavor, but it’s not a religious experience, either."

Nose has a good deal of sharp alcohol--the nail polish kind--and huge butterscotch notes. Surprisingly the maltiness is hidden behind the barrel sweetness and the sharp booze. Taste is big sweet caramel and butterscotch, dark malt, medium roast, a touch of charcoal, and just...smooth. Very warming in the belly, though it’s not particularly hot going down. Thick as hell, and not very carbonated. Just not my thing anymore--I’m glad I tried it, but if this is the pinnacle of imperial stout, then I guess I really don’t need to have anymore imperial stouts. I feel like I’ve either moved on from or burned out on the style."

Lots of coconut, lots of vanilla, woody notes, warming alcohol, chocolate, dark toffee, dark ripe cherries, liquorice, the characteristic dark sweet fruits and burnt figs fresh from the oven! The taste is just big creamy and smooth all over. Along with all the components from the aroma, the taste add that salty quality to the beer, also an actual whiskey taste.

Taste- Very hot. Dark chocolate. Vanilla. Some coffee. 

Mouthfeel- Not as thick as you would think but very good. 

Overall- Very good. Sweet as hell. Sticks to your lips. The aroma is definitely the most interesting part."
Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"(2, 97)",4.3,"From notes.  First reviewed 11/28/2010.  Served on tap in a Black Friday commemorative tasting glass at the GI brewpub. 5 oz. pour. I think the pours were a bit cold, so I allowed it to warm before getting into the glass.

The pour is a midnight black, with a small coffee colored thick creamy foam head on top. Some retention, but no real lacing to speak of. 

The roasted malt, oakiness, and bourbon from the Pappy barrels come through really nicely. The aroma is more pleasant than the regular bourbon county. It is smoother and the difference in the quality of the bourbon barrels is apparent. 

The dark roasted malt and Pappy-soaked oak flavors really blend well, especially with two years of age on it. The smoothness of the taste over time is what really impresses me about this family of beers. Molasses, some smoked tobacco, coffee, and figs come in after it warms up a little bit. These flavors all combine effortlessly in a tasty aged stout.

The feel of the bourbon county stouts is always nice, and this is no exception. It is very thick and creamy, with the body practically squeezing the carbonation out of it. The alcohol is pretty much hidden, quite a feat at 13%.

I liked this a little bit more than the regular bourbon county (accounting for age differential as well), but the price tag is a bit steep."
Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010,"(2, 98)",4.5,"Bottle. Thanks to Enjoyit. Pours black with a small, fast-disappearing brown head. Complex aroma; sweet and dry with notes of nougat, nuts, alcohol, dark fruits and chocolate. Very nice. Flavour is sweet and tart, with dark fruits, nougat and alcohol. The alcohol is a bit overpowering, and I think there might have been more nuances in the flavour if the alcohol hadn’t overshadowed it. Still pretty damn good though. Finish is the same, with a lingering alcohol burn. Overall this was great; complex and well-balanced, and the nougat notes were especially enjoyable, and not the least bit cloying, as could have been expected. 17.02.12."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(1, 5)",4.1,"Batch 2 750ml bottle.  Pours a pitch black color that looks like thick motor oil and capped by a small tan layer of foam that shows good retention before settling into a thin film. Looks as menacing as ever like Hunaphu’s always did.  The aroma shows notes of dark chocolate, cinnamon, toasted nuts, and earthy chili peppers over a very dark roasted malt base with hints of old oak, and spicy rum notes.  I’m not getting much from the Apple brandy barrel.  The flavor follows suit with the dark chocolate, vanilla, and cinnamon up front and backed up by the earthy chili peppers that adds some heat on the back end. The barrel presence is minimal and there is some oxidation from the age, but the alcohol is fairly restrained.  Full bodied and fairly smooth with subtle carbonation that leads to a dark chocolate, cinnamon, and spicy chili peppers on the finish with some lingering notes of rum and oak.  Interesting enough for sure and the Huna are all still there but the barrels don’t really bring everything together like I was hoping for and the barrel expression isn’t quite as pronounced as I would like.  Nowhere close to the greatness that was Batch 1, but still a good imperial stout that is worth trying if you can finda bottle."

The hint of brandy cannot be found over this rum. Texture is full with a moderate pepper heat after the swallow. Slight warming after the finish. Is this a huge bold stout? Of course it is.

 Was this a huge whale that I could not ever land? …. It was. Is it a tad overhyped?... You can judge for yourself. A buddy of mine paid a ludicrous amount of money so I could sample this. For that I am very grateful."

Imperial Stout With Cacao & Spices Added. 50% Aged In Rum Barrels, 50% Aged In Apple Brandy Barrels.

Alkohol: 11% obj.

Kolor: Czarny jak oczy rozwścieczonego boga ognia Hun-Hunaphu

Piana: Beżowa, skromna o drobno ziarnistej strukturze. 
Głośno syczy i opada do niewielkiego paseczka. Na krawędziach TeKu pozostają punktowe plamki. 

Zapach: Jest miazga! Aromat rozpieprza na maksa. Na początek rum i rodzynki macerowane w tym szlachetnym trunku. Potem cała gamma suszonych owoców, kandyzowane jabłka, śliwki, morele i winogrona.
Zaraz po tym potworny cios prosto w twarz od ziaren kakaowca, gęstej mlecznej czekolady i belgijskich pralin. 
Knock out zapewnia szereg elementów toffi, kawy, rodzynek, cukru trzcinowego i przypraw korzennych.
Przepiękny bukiet!

Smak: Niewiarygodny beczkowy profil. Euforię smaków rozpoczyna szlachetny rum o jego mocnym i bezkompromisowym smaku, pełnym przypaw korzennych i drewna. Następnie wkracza z wielką werwą beczka po jabłkowej Brandy (czyli jak domniemam po Calvadosie) nadając trunkowi posmak pieczonej szarlotki.
Kolejne warstwy bukietu smaków to lawina czekolady, toffi, pralin belgijskich, trzciny cukrowej, drewna, rodzynek i toffi.
Ostatnia prosta należy z całą pewnością do przypraw z których najbardziej wyróżnia się chilli, stawiając kropeczkę nad „i”, poszczypując w gardle. 
Alkohol jest obecny, rozgrzewa, trochę mąci w głowie, ale na szczęście nie ma ciepłego, rozpuszczalnikowego charakteru i nie wychodzi przed szereg.
Ciała Double Barrel Hunaphu’s nie brakuje.
Dostojny, szlachetny charakter trunku zapewni wiele minut udanej, owocnej degustacji.

Wysycenie: Niskie.

Podsumowanie:

Nareszcie!! Hunahpu’s (kilka roczników) - NIE! Bourbon Barrel Aged Hunahpu’s - NIE!
I dopiero Double Barrel Hunahpu’s - zdecydowanie TAK! 

Przecudowne piweczko dające tyle radości i satysfakcji z degustacji!
Głęboki profil smakowy i zapachowy, oszałamiające beczki po Rumie i Calvadosie.
Balans, głębia, różnorodność, klasa i szyk.

Najlepsze piwo w dorobku Cigar City Brewing!

Taste is quite complex, lots of chocolate and rum noticeable at first, with a decent bit of cinnamon and vanilla coming through as well. The chili really grows as you drink and the beer warms. Quite noticeable in the aftertaste in a really pleasant way. Quite a bit of warm boozyness there as well, but very smooth and mellow at the same time.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(1, 37)",3.9,"Batch 2. Thanks Virby44 for sharing the bottle! Poured into a snifter showing pitch black with very thin translucent brown rims and very sparse latte colored foam. 

The nose shows strong rum influence with moderately intense fruit forward notes of apple and cinnamon. 

The palate is oily, slick, and well carbonated. Cinnamon forward spiciness with a strong rum background throughout. Mid-palate warms up with chilies, followed by light notes of baked apple, finished by more apple, cinnamon, and a moderate coffee bitterness to tie it off. Moderate spiciness throughout."

Not really a my style, but it is good."

On the palate, a whack of cinnamon, extra sweet sugars, toffee, molasses, and then there's a cinnamon, nutmeg, touch of anchoish chile...so rich and delicious. Here, the barrel shows with a touch of rum, but aside from some late heat I'm not sure there's much of the brandy barrel. The spicy chile and cinnamon still comes through in the finish."

(from 75cL bottle @ Leuven Innovation Beer Festival, Leuven 2015. Huge thanks for sharing, Don! Yes, we agreed that you would take something nice to share in return for my efforts getting you a rare lambic, but this was overdoing it, in style. Thank you, sir!)"
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 7)",4.7,"Bottle sample @ Leuven Beer Innovation 2015, shared with the RB Belgian crew. Huge thansk to Tinus for sharing this bottle.
On retrouve le profil typique de Hunaphu à savoir une forte composante des malts et un profil simplement incroyable de chocolat, de cannelle avec une pointe d’épice. Le tout est apporté à un autre niveau par l’usage des barriques qui sont toutes deux en balance.
Le palais est très épais, liquoreux mais sans qu’aucuns éléments ne passent pour surfait. En bouche, une vraie fête de saveurs où s’entrechoquent les épices et toutes les saveurs des malts. Unique!"

Insane! Chocolate, pure cacao 100% - a hint at brandy and rum, fruity jumble. Filthily rich to woo a saint, no carbonation (and not necessary). This is truly unworldly.  Big thanks to Martinus!"
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 9)",4.8,"#5000. BIG thanks to digita7693 who generously shared this @ Leuven Innovation Beer Festival. The perfect beer for 5000 – one of my biggest wants for 5000 actually – I never thought that I was going to actually try this one. Many thanks for all the great company & beers during the course of all the previous ratings, festivals, tastings etc. Back when I started out trying beers many years ago, I thought that didn’t like beer because all that I knew was pale lager & the occasional Duvel. Tired of always drinking pale lager I decided to try some other beers & for a long time I tried one or two new ones per week at a bar near the university. They had about 40 beers I thought that there must be only about 100 – 200 beers in the world and that outside of Belgium they were all pale lagers. I decided to try nearly all of the beers in the world, as time went on I realized just how wrong I was… Back when I realized just how many beers there were in the world, I thought that trying more like 5000 would be impossible for me over a lifetime,… Turns out I was very wrong. Anyway as for the beer itself…. Deep dark black, looks very viscous, some mocha bubbles but they are quickly gone. Nose is huge thick, spirit-like, huge rum & brandy I suppose, very spirit-like so maybe brandy dominates a big, thick chocolate sludge, warming, chocolate syrup, deep black chocolate, huge oak & spirit presence, almost hot,… Taste is surprisingly cinnamon forward, by far the most of the Hunahpu’s I have tried so far, rich spirit, chocolate syrupy, warming high quality alcohol, black chocolate, very viscous, light espresso, very thick brownie dough, hugely thick & viscous, creamy, warming, thick exotic sugar,… Insanely thick & high quality spirit lingers on afterwards. Impressive, Stranahan still probably remains my favourity. Very happy to have tried one of my biggest wants."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 10)",5,"Courtesy of Martinus at Leuven Innovation Beer Festival the first time I had this, big thanks for this one. Almost no head, some loose beige bubbles which quickly disappear (probably because this precious bottle has been opened and resealed over and over again), colour a very dark burgundy, near black. Absolutely wonderful aroma of infinite complexity: a strong perfume of noble chocolate, vanilla, coconut, cinnamon, hint of dried soft chili pepper, espresso, soy sauce, bayleaf, candied dates, old port and old sherry, marzipan, banana liqueur... Truly incredible. Taste is equally amazing, a symphony of candied fruits, slight salty soy sauce accents, sweet marzipan and ’Bounty’ candy coconut plus chocolate, caramel and tons of chocolate fondant, all playing in a thick, heavy, profound texture; finish has more bitter chocolate and fine coffee in store, enriched with a vinous, warming alcohol effect of the finest brandy or single malt you can find, still a very faint hint of chili and peppery hops drying a bit and leaving you flabbergastered as if you just swallowed the most precious liquid ever made. This belongs to the most complex, most rewarding and most satisfying things I ever tasted.  I felt privileged enough being able to taste this whale the first time, but I had double luck in encountering it (from a younger and later batch) a second time at B.U.M.B.A. yesterday - this time adorned with a moussy, pale beige head and with a somewhat 'fresher' aroma, which was so incredibly stunning that I have no choice but to grant this a perfect score.  I cannot honestly see how a stout, or any top-fermented beer for that matter, could get any better than this..."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 18)",4.9,"Many thanks to Kevin for the bottle.

Pours a pitch black, motor oil color, revealing a slick viscosity after swirling, with a hazelnut brown, small head, which soon disappears.
Leaves back alcoholic spider legs, mingling into the darkness of the beer.


Smells of spiced, hot, chocolate, together with a wooden, slightly fruity burn. The scorched malts blend very smoothly into the hot qualities of the beer, both chilies and alcohol. Provides a rich bakers chocolate layer, enriching the unique spiciness, by ending up being a ebenbürtiger, smooth counterpart to them. Brandy exhibits a certain apple fruitiness, which gets picked up by faint lemony tequila, gently wrapped up by cinnamon and chocolate. 

Has an outstandingly smooth mouthfeel, with a lower carbonation, giving the beer enough room to unfold its full, complex body.

Tastes of alcoholic truffels, with a fruity whiff, coated up by cinnamon and chilies. All flavors are very pronounced and well integrated into the overall taste, mainly defined by a decadent mexican chocolate foundation. The beer got a spicy chili bite to it, inviting an alcoholic, wooden flavor to the palate, while both flavors blend flawlessly into each other, providing a unique depth, backed up by ashy chocolate and cinnamon. No booziness hovers above the different, diverse flavors, due to chocolate malts, which are incredible well pronounced, building upa prominent backbone. Finishes with matured, slightly bitter hops, with all other flavors still being recognizable, especially the wooden, part floral, part fruity spirits, which provide a harsh, but pleasant dryness.

This beer is fantastic, its well balanced depth of flavor is far superior to the base beer, with both barrels enriching the flavor. Results in a never before experienced complexity in a spiced imperial stout, with cinnamon being even more present than in the regular version, accentuating the malty chocolate qualities of the beer perfectly. The double burn, due to chilies and spirits, acts as a long lasting, pleasant and well integrated peak, slowly evolving from the luscious chocolate."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 20)",4.2,"Bottle; Pour is murky , oily dark, with a fairly modest fine bubbled dark khaki head into this snifter - it retains fairly modest as well, I suppose, with light spotting presence. The nose is rich chocolate cake, powerful cinnamon, moving to graham cracker crust, and clear vanilla presence as well. There is feint vegetal quality here, with some earthen barrel notes as well. The nose is not the highlight here at all - but I knew what was to come - The flavor profile reveals a robust and fairly complex hunahpu variant - its sticky sweet, with chocolate cake and vanilla bean initial - caramel and cacao moving forward. The rum / apple brandy barrel treatment is a nice combo - although I wouldn’t have been able to pick out the apple brandy without knowing it ahead of time. Cinnamon is naturally powerful here, with mild heat - it ends mild bitter with that lingering heat and a somewhat dry finish line"

Pours completely, oily black with a thin tan head that slowly recedes to bubbly lace. The nose is very rich, with tons of Mexican hot chocolate, vanilla, really great molasses rum, a really nice dose of maple and brown sugar, and just a bit of tingling burn on my nostrils. The flavor is rich milk and dark chocolate up front, a bit less cinnamon than on the nose, but just enough, moving to more molasses rum, vanilla, brown sugar, and a nice hint of spicy chili pepper that has a nice burn from my throat to my belly. The body is very full and creamy with light, but just enough carbonation, and a very long oaky chocolate, cinnamon, and spicy finish.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 60)",4.1,"Shared by neat people of uncertain identities at a location remote of my dining room. 

The beer pours basically black with a smallish head. There is some sheeting on the glass, for sure. 



The aroma is huge, roasty & oaky with lots of vanilla and chocolate. It’s very sweet smelling with a mild spiciness and some light alcohol. 

Terribly inviting.



The flavor is awfully complex, unknowing that there was any apple brandy barrels involved in the production of this beer I certainly noticed some calvados character to it. It’s remarkably chocolaty and defiantly very sweet (but not without balance) It’s got vanilla, and cinnamon, and a nice warming booziness. The beer is jus over the top in all aspects, and perhaps it’s a touch too sweet and a touch too boozy, but these are easily forgiven given the depth of flavor and the utter richness of the beer.



I hesitate to give this one a 5 on palate, although the sheer thickness and mouth coating syrupy nature of it generally lent my opinion towards that inclination. Over the top is over the top though, and that one luxurious as it is may be pushing excess in the mouthfeel department. 



Really fun beer for sure. 

I think I prefer just plain ol’ Hunahpu though."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 61)",4.1,"Rate #4,000!! Bottle via trade. Poured a pitch black oily body with a super small dark brown head. Aroma is rsther fruity, lots of dark berries, cinnamon, peppers, dark toast and sugary chocolate. Great body for a BA beer, syrupy big full palate, softer carbonation, sticky, lingering sweetnes and a touch of heat from the peppers. Flavor is betterthan the aroma, dark berries, chocolate, vanilla, pepper, cinnamon and applr brandy. Good stuff and really different from the alcobomb BA stuff out there."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 62)",4.6,"Bottle shared by a friend. Pitch black in color with a medium brown head. Aroma of bourbon, chocolate, slight cinnamon and pepper. Chocolate fudge flavor with cinnamon and slight alcohol warmth before a bourbon finish."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 63)",3.9,"Bottle 750ml. Thx David.
Pours jet black with low light brown head. Good lacing. Aroma is of gingerbread, vanilla, coffee, chilies. Taste is of coffee, chocolate, molasses, sugar, roasted malt, ashes, hot, chilies, brandy. Palate: Full bodied. Thick. Soft carbonation. Hot feeling. Overall: Peppers balance not too shabby. A bit spicy overall. Nice complexity. Just a tiny tad too hot."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 64)",4.3,"Bottle, thanks to David! Pours a deep black with dark brown ring. This has to be the most aromatic beer as far as spices go, the aroma is insanely intense. It feels like a dessert buffet: gingerbread, chocolate cake, vanilla, cinnamon bun, apple turnover. Moderate (well balanced) habanero notes to up these dessert spices even more (aroma and taste). Taste is very sweet (a little cloying) and the apple brandy barrels has a very nice presence. Palate is rather light for such a big beer. I’m not sure I enjoyed it that much but it was definitly an experience, even compared to the other very decadent versions I’ve had."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 66)",4.5,"Finally got to try this. Its pretty outstanding, however, I like the original apply brandy version a tad more. The barrel character seems lost, I wish it wasted more boozy because this is one decadent beer. Its a touch to sweet to crush a bunch, so with the alcohol cutting it, I could finish the whole bottle. You can get a bunch of raisin, toffee, brown sugar, a touch of vanilla. Super chewy. This is a must try."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 67)",4.3,"Poured from bottle to glass. Dark hue with tan head. Aroma is toffee, wood, vanilla, figs, molasses, caramelized sugar, cinnamon. Mouthfeel is great with a full body and soft carbonation. Taste is sweet throughout with a nice astringent bitterness in the following and an ethanol finish. Overall this is an amazing beer."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 68)",4.1,"Bottle via unknown, bottle share at de Garde. Pours an evil looking thin brown, not much head.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 69)",4.3,"Bottled. Pours pitch black with a small creamy, lacing tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, coffee, caramel, dark chocolate, rum, wood and vanilla. Sweet flavor that ends up more dry with alcohol, notes of chili and a hint of bitterness. Full bodied, oily to creamy texture and flat carbonation. A complex world class brew."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 70)",4.6,Stop the beer bullying. Tap at jdubs. Black hole dark with deep khaki head. Sweet heat wood coffee and molasses aroma with notes off caramel toffee sugar. This beer starts very sweet caramel toffee coffee wood. It then moves to a full body chocolate stout with nots of bitter chocolate vanilla graham cracker. Finishes with a warmth of spices: cinnamon nutmeg and chipotle peppers. This barrel treatment still holds up the original. Well done CCB.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 72)",4.8,"**Warning** -- This beer may cause a side effect of Tourette Syndrome...because I found myself blurting uncontrollable profanities as I drank this! ""Holy sh*t!"" ""Son of a b@$&h!"" and ""Motherf^*%$!"" spewed from my inner dialogue, out of my mouth and into the ears of those at the tasting. The appearance was of a very dark, thin tan-headed monster that had legs creeping up the glass for days. The nose was loaded with an arsenal of spice (cinnamon and pepper), loads of chocolate, dash of vanilla along with an ever so delicate brandy sweetness. A head-snap jerking motion triggered yet a few more profanities. ""No f*&^%@$g way!"". The first sip was even better than I could have imagined. Such balance between this cornucopia of ingredients. Loads and loads of dry chocolate coats the palate, allowing the cinnamon, tobacco and vanilla to leave their impressions. Soon, I found that I was not alone in experiencing this side effect. Our whole group began to curse in unison....as an outsider looking in, I am sure it was a horrendous site. Apologies to any witnesses that may have been harmed or offended by these outbursts! The finish brought forth more of the Brandy Barrel than the Rum, according to my palate.....with just enough heat from the peppers to cut the very present sweetness that lingers throughout. All in all, a very outstanding beer that pushes the boundaries of flavor and delicacy. Was there any booze in this? ...because I sure didn’t taste any."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 73)",4.3,"Bottle shared at Natifest ’14. Poured a black color with an average frothy brown head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy roasted coffee, chocolate, fruit and wood aroma. Heavy toasted chocolate malt and complex alcohol flavor with a heavy dark sweet and small alcohol bite finish of moderate to long duration. Full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. This is another standout beer."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 74)",4.6,"750ml bottle pours dark oil black brown with small thin layer of foam. The nose is spectacular with interwoven notes of spicy apple brandy, chili, rich roasty cocoa, rum cola spice, cinnamon, and vanilla. Taste is equally as complex, silky mouthfeel bursting with chocolate, spices, subtle chili, cinnamon, apple brandy, vanilla, fruity rum, the various flavors swirl and dance around always revealing new layers and flipping your ideas of what you are tasting. The finish is mouth-coating rich bittersweet chocolate, vanilla cream, spicy rum, apple cinnamon, cocoa. Truly awesome."

Andy is spot on, this beer smells like ""oatmeal cookies with apple"" cider and a hint of cinammon. I would take it a bit further and cay that there’s also some really deep black cherry with a splash of vanilla. Just tasted it... H-O-L-Y shit! This beer is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Dried cherry, hints of cinammon, chocolate, and even a hint of pepperiness in the back end. I’m really speachless when it comes to this beer. It’s truly phenomenal. Best beer of the day by a mile!"

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 78)",4.2,750ml bottle thanks to a generous soul at NF14 - nose is barrel wood and general dark malts. Sweet.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 79)",4.4,"750 ml bottle to taster at NatiFest (BIG thanks to jstax!). Looks good; a viscous very dark cola with thin mocha head that steadily dissipates into lacing. Smells great; dark malt, molasses, and brandy with a bit of rum in the background. Tastes like it smells with even more of a cocoa presence. The expensive kind of cocoa that you’d expect to find in a gourmet chocolate store. A touch of dark coffee woven in. Exceptionally smooth. Fantastic stuff!"
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 80)",4.2,"750ml bottle, thanks to jstax for sharing this at Natifest! Black color. Minimal ring of brown head. Wonderful nose... Apple brandy comes through nicely, plays well with the rest of the hunahpu flavors. Dark chocolate, cinnamon in the nose. I spent several minutes just smelling this. Bigger body. Good chewy thicker texture to this, slightly syrupy. Just a very light peppery kick in the finish. Moderate to bigger bitter taste. Some light heat to it. Moderate sweet. Fantastic tasty complex imperial stout. Great coffee in the aftertaste, and light pepper finish. Thanks for sharing this one Jeremy!"

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 83)",4,"Bottle via Eric and shared with some Peesie Beer Porners in my crappy motel room in Ypsilanti Michigan post MiBGSF 2014: love the old oak, tobacco, overripen apple and plum. Still get some spices but more on palate than nose. Pretty good amount of sweeter cocao and vanilla left around. The mouth feel is a bit thinned out by the barrels but still nicely oily. Overall it matched my high expectations."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 84)",4.1,"Much thanks to Dice for opening this bottle. Pours motor-oil thick, dense and viscous. Aroma: Loads of chocolate, with some cinnamon and spicy pepper. Rum, a little bit of copper. Also, soy sauce. So much soy sauce. Taste: Mexican mocha, condensed into a syrup and spiked with rum. Beautiful chocolate that lasts and lasts, coating the mouth with so much chocolate. Chili peppers and metal. Very sweet, but the peppery finish stops it just short of being cloying. Roasty, peppery finish. Full, syrupy body. Overall: cool beer, glad to have tried it."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 87)",4.6,"Bottle share in Orland Park. Pour is black with a medium brown head. Aroma of sweet brown sugar, vanilla extract, coconut, spices, and a touch of rum. Flavor of chocolate fudge, apple brandy, pound cake, cinnamon, burnt caramel, and wood chips. Finish is slight warming from the chili spice and alcohol, but balanced nicely by the sweetness. Amazing."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 88)",3.6,"Aroma is somewhat spicy with a touch of soy sauce. Light rum and brandy notes with quote a bit of raisin notes. Moderate chocolate and cinnamon notes. 
Pours a motor oil black with a small mocha head that quickly recedes to the edges where it lingers a bit. 
Flavor had moderate sweetness with quite a bit of spice and some cinnamon notes. A decent chocolate character with faint roast. As it warms it gets better but I am still not a huge fan. 
Mouthfeel is full bodied with medium low carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, am interesting and decent beer, but I don’t love the adjunct character. The spice isn’t great and the barrel treatment isn’t support noticeable. I’m not a huge fan."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 89)",4.3,"Many bottles, many times.



Pours dark chocolate/black, tan-colored head, thin right, wisps. Nose is sweet milk chocolate, smooth booze, oak, rich & creamy, maybe a trace of chilies. Flavor is similar to the nose, which is excellent. Chocolate, smooth booze, oak, cream, molasses, caramel. One of the best Hunahpu’s variants ever made and right up there with fresh Apple Brandy. Body is full, light perfect carbonation, creamy rich finish.



Overall, an excellent barrel-aged imperial stout...get this if you can!"
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 90)",5,"Bottle. Huge thanks to the local group for sharing this with me. Pours deep black, very dense. Very little head on the pour but still looks awesome. Aroma is ridiculously good. Can smell it from a couple feet away. Apple brandy, chocolate chip cookies, berries, vanilla, cinnamon, soy, and marshmallow. Tastes just as incredible as the aroma. Apple brandy, chocolate chip cookies, sugar cookies, chocolate syrup, cinnamon, light smokey peppers, and a hint of dried dark fruit. Perfect mouthfeel as well. Very low carbonation makes this extremely smooth and allows the huge flavors to stand out. I’ve had a couple days to think about this beer and I’m convinced it’s the best beer I’ve ever had. My first perfect 5. I would trade many bottles in my cellar to get another one of these."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 91)",4.6,"Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, faint molasses, and espresso. It pours a dark brown with no transparency with a very fine brown ring. The flavor starts moderate-heavy chocolate with faint molasses. The finish has moderate cinnamon/cinnabuns, fruit, brandy, and vanilla. It’s dull bodied with mild carbonation and a slightly oily mouthfeel. Overall, this is outstanding and reminds me a little of BA Abraxas."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 92)",4.8,"Poured from a bomber into a wine glass. Dark pour, but not motor oil like. Little head. Very boozy aroma (more of brandy than rum) with moderate soy saucey smell. Flavor is terrific, as expected. The beer is quite sweet, but not cloying or overwhelming like dark lord. The blended barrels work well, though I do think the brandy is much more prominent. The chilis are faded a little bit compared to regular Hunahpu but that is to be expected with so much going on. Despite the huge smith of flavors in this beer it has a unified coherent flavor. Really great stuff."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 93)",3.4,"Bottle broken out a tasting by Douglas. Thanks! 

A: Thick black body, cappuccino head. 

N: Pepper, cinnamon, cocoa, vanilla, caramel, apple brandy, rum, sugars, chilies. 

T: Sweet as hell, pretty much cloying except for the intense spiciness on the back of the throat. Chocolate and chili is usually good, but I’m not digging this concoction. 

M: Huge body, sticky, oily.

O: A different version of this well known RIS. Like the Apple Brandy variant, it is intense. However, despite the complexity, it’s not actually something I want to drink. It’s just too much, and that doesn’t appeal to me."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 94)",4.1,"750 ml bottle thanks to Dan. Pours a jet black color with a small brown head. A big sweet boozy nose with clear rum and sugary sweet malts. Dark chocolate, rum, heat, coconut, a bit of licorice and brown sugar. The brew is overall really sweet and hot, but complex. The clear brandy and rum barrels make it shine. Loads to love here. The beer is actually very drinkable despite being boozy and super sweet. I think most of the work here is due to the barrels, awesome treatment."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"(2, 95)",4.3,"Bottle sample from ""Douglas88"". Colour...totally black with no head. Helluva a lot of tendrils on the swirl. Nose...sharp, intense and loaded with Bourbon vanilla, rum, burnt marshmallow and hints of apple brandy in apple tart flavour. Palate... instantly bitter, tangy and then ultra sweet! The cocoa is quite intense and then there’s plenty of coffee to go with it all. The booze is quite evident and yet its well blended with the flavours that are present. Ultra dark chocolate exists thorough out and adds to the bittersweet chocolate finish. Noice stuff! Thanks, Doug!"

Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"(1, 51)",4.6,"On tap in Madison, WI

Toppling Goliath has a reputation for excellence which made this the main draw for a night out at one of Madison's best bars. Worth every penny of the cost, it delivers an experience unrivalled by all but the best of the best. Despite the lines I may have to make a detour to their booth at the Great Taste this year to get another pour.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
A deep oily black core permeates the glass and stains everything it touches. A minimal head tracks the long icy legs which melt like sheets of snow on a warm spring day. Plums, raspberry, anise, and coffee hang in the air with a glowing warmth that feels mellow and dense. There's no mistaking the ABV but even so it feels very approachable.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Warm espresso, dark chocolate, plums, and blackberries coat the palate with layers of boozy sediment. The dense flavors complement each other so well that it is nearly effortless to follow each sip with another. The mildly bitter finish continues to warm the throat well after the glass is empty. Overall there is only one complaint - that I did not order a full pour when offered the opportunity."
Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"(1, 52)",4.4,"Very dark beer out of the bottle with a short foamy brown head. Big alcohol and maple nose. Huge sweet maple syrup flavor with some chocolate, vanilla and sweetened coffee. Really rich dessert beer. Balanced enough to handle everything in here."

Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"(1, 54)",4.5,"22oz bottle courtesy of IPhonePhan, pours an oily, cola brown with no head.  That will be my only complaint.  Nose is WILD, I mean stupid, big big maple pancakes, coffee, dried berries, caramel.  Not a boozy note to be found.  Flavor is just good, coffee, maple, vanilla, berries, caramel.  There's a clear pancake thing happening - clearly pancake.  Smooth finish.  A real treat."

Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"(1, 59)",5,"My first beer review in over 2 years, felt like this was so good I had to.  Gifted a bottle from a friend in Milwaukee and enjoyed in Savannah, GA.

Definitely one of the best beers I’ve ever had."

Pristine aroma, and perfect flavor. Fantastic!"

Very dark brown pour with a brown head. Aroma has maple, chocolate, and roast. Strong, super smoothly blended, with very solid identifiable contributors. Taste is of sweet maple, dark chocolate, sweet malts, a barrel component, and roast. This leans sweet, with the roast just not being enough to battle all that sweet. Smooth. Very tasty. Just sweet. About full bodied, with a subtle alcohol presence, the blend is very, very good. Finishes to the sweet side, with the bitter parts losing the balance battle. This was excellent, very enjoyable, and properly rated. 17.8"

Nose has freshly baked waffles with maple syrup and chocolate spread on the top, served with a nice cup of freshly brewed coffee. Serve me this with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. Tastes more like a beer, oily, roast bitterness comes out at first, then maple sweetness comes with chocolate. Coffee beans, lightly drier finish, maple also present in the linger. Sweet pastry stout, I do like this, feels somewhat more real than Omnipollo's Gideon's Pancake for example."

A waxed bottle that basically took a chainsaw to get through. A dense coffee black pour with a thick, espresso brown foam head. First initial response is the maple content. Lots of it. And it's delicious. The ultimate breakfast brew here with a coffee and maple pairing. Really thick body. Thick milk chocolate, caramel, maple, and low bitter coffee follow up. Reminds me a bit of the Evil Twin Michigan Jesus. Boozy indications on the aroma, but the flavor couldn't get much more smooth. Premier dessert stout here. 859417"

Thick and dark body. Nose is distinctly maple, with some tomato sweetness, and chewy and bitter coffee and cocoa. Moderately thick sip, doesn’t feel too hot, with a nice chewy bitterness at the end to cut up he sweetness. Coffee, cocoa, maple. Lots of dark caramel and Hersey’s syrup. Sticky edges. Tastes well aged. Tomato like notes are the only spoiler, but this is rather tasty overall. Lingering bitter finish is fantastic. (Note: I’m leaving my blind rating intact but I’m tempted to add .1 for the remarkable balance of alcohol in this, I had no idea tasting this blind that it was 12%)."

Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"(2, 10)",3.7,"12 oz batch 4 bottle opened during Wakefest weekend. Pours nearly pitch black in color and topped by a thin, tan layer of foam that settles in quickly and rejoins the body below and leaves some sudsy lace behind. The aroma shows notes of dark chocolate, huge maple syrup, dark, over roasted coffee, espresso, toasted caramel, and hints of vanilla. The flavor follows suit the dark chocolate and over roasted coffee right up front which turns into a green pepper flavor from over roasting the coffee beans, and then followed by notes of sweet maple, toasted vanilla, and caramel. The maple component isn't as prevalent in the flavor and its hard to get the green pepper flavors from the coffee. Medium bodied and smooth with soft carbonation that leads to a dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and sweet maple finish that lingers on for a bit. I was really excited to try this, but this unfortunately fell way short of the hype and my expectations. Maybe one day I'll get to try an earlier batch that everyone raves about."

O wiele bardziej intensywny aromat, ogrom syropu klonowego, kwaskowosci i charakteru wloskiego espresso, troche orzecha wloskiego. W smaku bardzo duzo kwasnosci deserowej czekolady i jakby jakiejs ziolowosci. Aromat bije na glowe 3 warke ale w smaku jest zbyt duza kwaskowosc."

Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"(2, 15)",4.7,"I'm rating batch 2 since b3 and b4 were not very good IMO. Another TG maple bomb. Aromas of maple and coffee are super prevalent. Flavors are maple and smooth roasted coffee. This blend is so smooth it's like drinking a maple coffee frappe. Feel is spot on. Overall, this is outstanding."
Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"(2, 16)",3.7,"12 oz. bottle from the brewery. (Really damn expensive. Plus you needed to win a raffle to buy and be present with the proper email notification) flavor and aroma are a mirror. Flavor is maple syrup, roasted coffee, weak chocolate, and is almost sticky sweet. The maple syrup comes through really strong. Brownie batter in waves. Really makes this overly sweet. Gosh, talk about an over hyped stout! Yikes !"
Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"(2, 17)",4,"Top 5 bottle from AFH! Thanks d000d! 12oz bottle, 3 ways in stemware at 45F. Alcohol legs for days, looks like marmalade in the glass. Smells like maple syrup and kahlua! Whoa, very sweet. LOADS of maple syrup, kahlua for sure. it's very sweet, maybe even akin to a little bit of soy sauce. This beer is so intense with flavor. It's good. not hiding any of the adjuncts."

Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"(2, 21)",4.4,"Batch 4. I thought it would be a maple dominated but it is a coffee dominated one. Quite enjoyable but it is not a balanced one. It is sort of ""pow pow - tons of coffee, sweetness etc."" good one though."

Imperial Stout Brewed With Maple Syrup & Coffee.  


 Alkohol:  12% obj. 


 IBU:  50 


 Kolor:  Czarny, nieprzejrzysty. 


 Piana:  Nie można się do niczego tutaj przyczepić. Beżowa, wysoka, bujna, zwarta piana.
Długi czas stoi jak zaczarowna w miejscu. 
Po opróżnieniu szkła wciąż pozostaje na jego ściankach. 


 Zapach:  Aromat jest masywny! Roztacza się szerokim łukiem nad całym pomieszczeniem i wypełnia je swoją intensywnością.
Nie musisz wcale przykładać nosa do butelki, aby poczuć gigantyczną woń syropu klonowego wspieranego przez najlepszej jakości kawę.
Tylko minimalna paloność połączona z nutami pralinek belgijskich, karmelu i wiodącej wanilii.
Pomimo, że piwo jest klasycznym Imperialem aromat miażdży większość najlepszych beczkowych RIS-ów jakie piłem.
Myślę, że właśnie dla takich piw jak to powinni wymyślać dodatkową skalę zapachową.
Poezja! 


 Smak:  Na języku dominuje przyjemny syrop klonowy.
Gęsty, pachnący, świeży.
Przywołuje skojarzenia z najlepszymi naleśnikami oblanymi syropem klonowym jakie jadłem kiedyś w Las Vegas w 
jednym z amerykańskich barów śniadaniowych. 
Po chwili dochodzi do tego kawa, która już po drugim łyku zaczyna dominować.
Lekka paloność i niski stopień kwaskowatości z miejsca ustawia to piwo w gronie najlepszych kawowych RIS-ów w moim portfolio. 
Smak uzupełniają akcenty gorzkiej i mlecznej czekolady, melasy, wanilii, pralinek belgijskich, karmelu, cynamonu i marcepanu.
Gęsta, oleista i ubita jak budyń tekstura.
Procenty po mistrzowsku zamiecione pod dywan.
Na języku pełne, słodkie, jedwabiste i kremowe. Pod koniec degustacji, po solidnym ogrzaniu w dłoniach, na końcu języka pojawia się minimalna kawowa kwaskowatość. W żadnym stopniu nie wpływa to na finalny odbiór trunku.
Doskonała robota! 
 

 Wysycenie:  Niskie. 
 

 Podsumowanie:  
 

Mornin' Delight - piwo z którym wkraczam w 2018 rok. 

2-gi najlepszy Imperial Stout na świecie.

Perfekcja, doskonałość i mistrzowskie zrozumienie tematu.
To jest prawdziwie w 100-ach oddający klimat amarykański Imperial Stout.
Dodatki dorzucone do piwa: syrop klonowy i kawa perfekcyjnie podkreślają to co dla Amerykanów jest ważnym elementem ich życia.
Balans poszczególnych składowych jest jest wręcz niebywały.
Dopieszczony do granic możliwości, od opakowania, przez wygląd, a na smaku skończywszy.
Bogaty, wielowarstwowy, na długo pozostanie w mojej pamięci.
Nie jest to co prawda mój No 1, 
ale na bank znajdzie się w Top10 moich Imperiali.

W aromacie sporo syropu klonowego i kawy - takiej świeże espresso colombiano. Wanilia praktycznie przykryta przez resztę składników. Po ogrzaniu wychodzi wyraźnie syrop klonowy. W smaku ta kawa jest wyraźnie zaznaczona - uderza swoją kwaskowatością. W smaku słodkie od początku do końca ponadto ta kawowa kwaskowatość. Ciało pełne, wzorcowe, tekstura oleista niczym olej silnikowy. Piwo z wyglądem i teksutrą w 100%, które wyciska maksimum treści z syropu klonowego oraz kawy."
Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"(2, 25)",4,"Oxford tasting; batch 4, 2017
Pitch black with medium sized dark brown head. The aroma is very strong, coffee, maple, wood, dark caramel, light smoke, cake, then traces of dark fruits. Good body structure, but only moderate residual sweetness, and very high acidity from the malts; the coffee dominates, some maple syrup, also too much liquorice in the final.
Great aroma, uncoordinated flavor; beast of beer, with no elegance."

The intensity of coffee, butterscotch, and maple syrup makes this beer all the more impressive being as balanced as it is. Dark brown in color. Creamy tan head.... It's hard to focus on this review. In short, this is the best beer I've ever tasted."
Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"(2, 31)",4.8,"THANKS to Kraddel! #11.000! Very happy to have actually tried this one. Bomber split by 4 people. Batch # 2. Totally black, head doesn’t last. Looks even thick upon poor, this beer is insanely thick. Nose is hazelnut paste sweet but also bit bitter, herbal nuts, walnuts pure mocha syrup, bitter molasses, syrup, very big coffee, espresso with some roast, pecan, maple is way lower than you would expect. This is not the pasty stout that I expected this to be, maple is quite low, barely there but this is way more about the coffee, espresso, coffee roast, even roasted malts & it is insanely thick, easily one the thickest beers that I have ever had, tastes of hazelnut ,more roast than expected, pure thick syrup, more molasses than maple almost pure malt syrup, heavy coffee bitter finish, expresso, decent roast, lingering nuts & inanely thick. Surprisingly balanced, surprisingly coffee forward. Liked it more & more the more I drank it, surprisingly drinkable despite the thickness. Really great beer, not the beer to end all beer as many have proclaimed it but is any beer? Would love to try the BA version at some point but that one is in ultra-high demand."
Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"(2, 32)",4.7,"Huge thanks to Dylan for sharing this personal whale! 🙌 Batch 2.
Nose is full on roasted coffee. Bit grainy. Huge chocolate truffle. The body is so thick, almost syrupy. very sweet too but never annoying. Immediately had sticky lips and tong from the intense sugary sweetnes. This is just straight alcoholic milk chocolate. Also reminds me of creamy high quality cappuccino. Aftertaste is a Bit burnt fruit. Like fruit compote which is nice. 
Only fault is I expected more maple. But that could have something to do with age. Love to compare this with other batches as there seems to be some differences."

Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"(2, 40)",4.7,"So here we are then: one of these hugely hyped Toppling Goliath stouts and the third highest ranking beer on this website at the time of writing this review, I've been looking forward to this for a long time. American-style imperial stout with coffee and maple syrup, 2016 vintage. Yellowish beige, creamy head, thin and open in the middle but retaining around the edge, on a black beer with warm mahogany edges. Very intense, concentrated, beguiling bouquet of chocolate fondant, chocolate liqueur, strong maple syrup, dried figs drenched in whisky, cappuccino and coffee liqueur, fudge, toasted chestnuts, dry leather, toffee, cognac, hazelnut oil, madera, subtle but clear glue-ish and solvent-like effects. The mouthwatering promises made by the aroma are perfectly met by the flavour, kicking off with thick sweet maple syrup embellished with dried fruit notes and a thin sourish accent, blending in well with the caramelly, toffeeish and profoundly nutty, big, oily malt body, perfectly (i.e. softly) carbonated fit for this style. The nuttiness shifts colours to a darker, bitter black 'chocolateness', bitterly toasty yet not overly roasted: the creaminess of the maple syrup lies a perfectly measured layer of soothing sweetness on top of it, and the no doubt copious amounts of coffee that went in here, provide delightful retronasal aromas and a refined, spicy, delicate and warm roastedness that is more expressive and vivid than the actual roasted barley. Ends with vanilla- and cinnamon-like accents, very rich, a coffee dessert with alcohol - which takes on a long, heating, brandy-like quality, yet at the same time completely avoids obnoxious wryness. Tasted this next to a 2015 vintage as well, which was just as rich and ravishingly beautiful, yet a tad softer and more rounded, a bit less sharp in terms of solvents and a little bit less aromatically coffee-ish - but these were 'microscopic' differences due to age alone, presumably. Well, now that I finally had a taste of this nectar of the gods: not sure if this is the single best stout I ever had - but it comes very, very close. Then again, the whole hype surrounding this beer, one of these artificially mystified beers (admittedly largely due to geeks like ourselves here, ironically perhaps), should not matter in judging this: any experienced taster with a basic technical knowledge will be able to assess that this is a work of great beauty, class and craftmanship. A huge, detailed and completely flawless construction of flavours, the essence of American-style RIS with maple syrup and coffee dosed in such a way that they actually accentuate the features of this beer in a tastefully balanced way rather than overpowering them.  Unforgettable, and I was over the moon when given the chance to sample it again - from tap - at Billie's Craft Beer Fest 2023, when it was oddly much smoother, more caramelly and more milk-chocolatey - yet still utterly delicious.  My rating here is an average of both encounters with this highly coveted stout."

Flavor is intense coffee bitterness, maple syrup sweetness, notes of vanilla, again, chocolate. Coffee predominates here. The balance of the intense coffee bitterness and the intense sweetness of the syrup is very interesting. Not bad, but I won't be seeking this one again."

Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"(2, 48)",4.3,"Thanks Jay for sharing the bottle! Poured into a Morning Delight espresso cup (inside joke for those who know my alcohol tolerance) showing pitch black with no head. 

The nose shows a pronounced maple syrup forwardness with an equally strong and balancing roast coffee background. 

The palate is full bodied, oily, slick and lightly carbonated. Maple syrup forward but still with a restrained moderate sweetness. Strong roasted coffee background throughout with a very light coffee tartness and more strong black coffee bitterness on the finish. Interplay and balance between maple syrup and coffee is incredible.

Strong nose of malt, maple syrup, coffee, chocolate and slight dark fruit. Very in your face. Maple and malt flavor giving way to smooth coffee, then transitioning to chocolate and heavy dark fruit before a roasty coffee finish. Perfection on the nose, but I would like a little more chocolate than dark fruit in the flavor. Great coffee and maple presence though. From what I hear, folks are liking it better than the 2016 batch."

Entre l’épaule d’agneau braisée et les fromages. À peine la capsule levée de la bouteille, une véritable explosion d’arômes d’érable envahit la pièce. Du sirop d’érable, de la tire d’érable sur la neige, de la pâte à biscuits aux pépites de chocolat non cuite... De la véritable folie! Une fois dans mon verre cependant, les arômes s’estompent curieusement rapidement. De mon verre s’échappent beaucoup plus de vapeurs d’érable que du verre de Marc-André. Je ressens encore beaucoup de chocolat mais surtout du café. Une base cependant verte me fait sourciller car cette dernière était la dernière chose à laquelle je m’attendais. Le café demeure tout de même au centre de toute l’action - au nez comme ne bouche. Des arômes de grains de café éthiopiens chauffés accentués par des brisures de chocolat au lait de qualité exceptionnelle. Et cette texture!!! Le liquide est léger comme une plume, voire aérien.

Some maple syrup, ground coffee, vanilla, green bitter coffee, dry cocoa beans and weak caramel. It’s overall a very good beer I think it is safe to say that I was let down by this beer. It smells amazing but I don’t follow the extreme hype on this one. Maybe I got the wrong batch?"

Nice, toasty maple syrup, super roasty, light hop presence, green coffee. Taste is surprisingly unsweet. Lots of bitter roast, bitter coffee, intense lakritol-like licorice. Pretty spicy, lots of maple flavor but very little of the sweetness. Bitter, roasty after taste. Makes me realize that i didn’t really knew what to expect from this beer, haha! Somewhat full body and a medium low carbonation. Really good stout, but don’t get the hype on this one."

Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,"(2, 83)",5,"This beer definitely lives up to hype. All you need is some patience. Shared a whole bottle with my lady. 
The first few sips were disappointing. Very much coffee forward, could taste some yummy caramel malt, just a hint of maple and chocolate at the end, extremely sticky and thick mouthfeel. But did it deserve the title of ""one of the best imperial stouts"" in the world? Hell nah. 
But it gets better. Much better. As the beer warms up, maple and chocolate flavor becomes much more dominant. On the other hand, coffee flavor mellows out. The best part is that the flavor lasts on your tongue forever. Orgasm in my mouth. Perhaps the best beer I’ve ever tasted.
For those who were disappointed, I’m telling you, wait until this beer warms up! I chilled on this bottle for 3 hours, and the flavor just kept on getting better and better... can’t wait to try Kentucky Brunch."

Imperial Stout with Neapolitan ice cream treatment.

Zapach: W aromacie jest prawdziwa magia! Inspiracja lodami Neapolitan, jak najbardziej trafiona w punkt. Tak jak na zamieszczonym na etykiecie obrazku - warstwy piwa rozkładają się dokładnie w ten sam sposób. Najpierw dogłębna, najlepszej jakości szwajcarska czekolada, wraz z nią kakao i melasa. Potem nie mniej intensywna wanilia, słodka deserowa, stanowiąca trzon centralny trunku.
Na koniec jogurt truskawkowy, lody z kawałkami truskawek i shake o tym samym smaku. Wszystkie 3 poziomy wzajemnie przenikają przez siebie tworząc spójną całość.

Smak: Smak na prawdę odbiera mowę. Najpiękniejszy i najpyszniejszy deser na świecie. 
Płynna czekolada z domieszkami orzechów migdałowych, leciutka kawa, melasa i ziarna kakaowca.
Od groma ciasteczek waniliowych i lodów.
Truskawka gdzieś tam się przewija. Nie ma najmniejszego problemu z wyłapaniem jej pomiędzy poszczególnymi. warstwami.
Tekstura gęsta i oleista. Brak nut alkoholowych.

The lovely scents of strawberries/vanilla/chocolate all waft up from the snifter along with a tiny bit of roast malt. While still nice, the strawberry aroma is a touch artificial when compared with the rest of the nose. Holy cavity, Batman! -- an intense, nearly overpowering sweetness dominates the flavor before the same Neapolitan blend makes its presence known. The proper components are all there -- it really does taste remarkably like a Neapolitan ice cream sandwich -- with a creamy vanilla and slightly boozy finish. Thick, syrupy mouthfeel. Massive kudos to Cycle for achieving the desired affect, but the overt sweetness is almost too much for more than a few sips."

This is used motor oil in the glass with a small dark brown head that hangs around as a thin ring. The aroma is really awesome. All of the strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla come through in a dried ice cream form. It’s like Dippin’ Dots. There is a light bourbon barrel quality to it, a nice molasses and a fudginess. The only thing I can knock on the aroma is the booziness is a bit strong for the sweet bits. The flavor is spectacular. There is a huge Neapolitan ice cream happening, with a big fudgness and a sweet molasses. It’s unbelievably complex. Everything just balances so well. The mouth feel is the incredible levels that 3 Sons imparts on their stouts. There is a heavy thickness that almost requires chewing. The carbonation is soft and only makes it cling to the mouth a little further. The aftertaste is lingeringly fudgy and full of molasses, with a bright dried Neapolitan ice cream lingering behind.

Split 2 ways with my wife the day we leave on our vacation. Pours still / flat. Slight legs in the glass. Rich mango gold color. The aroma fills the room. It’s like cracking up a sherry cask just pouring it. The nose in the glass sweet orange peel, cherry, wood, orange candies, banana, almonds and toasted coconut. It’s very complex. I’m going to remember this beer for a very long time. Still and flat, certainly a young lambic but a LOT of wood, coconut, banana, fortified wine, mango and peaches. Wow. Finish is long and smooth.

Overall: I'm a big fan of sherry, however sherry matured Zenne y Frontera always frustrated me. For B5 I got typical Fino characters instead of Oloroso and PX, however it's still enjoyable, anyway. Unfortunately, the prestigious B1 disappointed me. It's very unlike lambic to be so spicy on nose while openning, meanwhile the sherry infulences(I was expecting tons of dried fruits, nuts and coffee chocolate characters from those 40 year old Oloroso and PX sherry casks) were still hard to identify, despite the spiceness could be recognized as Oloroso. It's quite decent on mouth in absolute terms, however inappropriate to it's price and championship nowadays. The bottle looks well kept, so I wonder why this was such overhyped.
我是个雪莉发烧友，但过雪莉桶的ZF系列一直让我很困惑。比如说B5我尝到的是Fino而不是Oloroso和PX，但再怎么说，它也还算愉悦。不幸的是，这支盛名在外的B1让我失望了。刚开瓶时如此抢戏的香料让此酒闻起来很不兰比克，与此同时雪莉风味依旧难以辨认（我原本期待着来自桶陈40年Oloroso和PX雪莉的海量坚果、咖啡和巧克力风味），虽说那些香料味可以被当作是来自Oloroso雪莉。从绝对意义上说，这酒喝起来还真不错，但显然跟它如今高高在上的价格与地位有些不匹配。这一瓶的保存状态看上去相当好，这就让我很好奇这款酒是怎么被吹到这种程度的。

3 Fonteinen Zenne y Frontera,"(1, 35)",4.8,"Well, here is then, a new 3F legend, bottle bought from a private collector - for a crazy price, but I could not resist. Shared with Jan of Weerspannige Brouwers. Medium thick, moussy, densely packed, pale yellowish white, lightly lacing, very stable head over a misty peach blonde beer with light orange hue. Complex and extremely elegant bouquet of gooseberry, unripe melon, lime juice, fermenting hay, wet wood, dry sherry indeed but well integrated into the whole, cava, moldy lemon peel, slight vanilla (oak?), unripe pear, mandarin peel, yoghurt, stale sweat but subtly so, passion fruit. Rich estery onset full of gooseberry, redcurrant, unripe plum and passion fruit, tart with a sweetish edge somewhere, champagne-like carbonation just fit for the style; soft lemony acidity (’mals’) and sedate lactic sourishness dominate the whole and dry the palate but again in an extremely elegant, ’friendly’ and softish kind of way, over a backbone of bready barley and soapy, deeply sourish wheat. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy, more ’moelleux’ than usual for a geuze. Passion fruit and gooseberry tartness persist towards the finish, pairing up with a brief but well-placed earthy ’old’ hop bitterish touch and drying, noble woodiness, bearing a sherry accent which blends in perfectly with the natural oloroso-like features of the lambic; a genuine sherry flavor subtly lingers in the back of the mouth after swallowing while the soft lambic tartness persists. A very subtle vanilla-like sweetish accent pops up too distinguishing this from other geuzes, along with the subtle sherry accent. In all, however, this sherry factor is just a touch of colour, rather than a dominant flavor imposed on it - I can easily see how this got its reputation and raving scores here. This is among the most elegant, noble and ’aristocratic’ lambic beers I ever had the pleasure to taste, it really doesn’t get much better than this. What a masterpiece... I’m even inclined to purchase another bottle for the same price and keep it in the cellar for some years. The perfect geuze, perhaps?"
3 Fonteinen Zenne y Frontera,"(1, 36)",4.2,"750 ml bottle, shared by Werckmeister, many thanks! Pours a lightly hazy golden color. Lots of barrel character in the aroma - sherry, Oloroso sherry, some mild funk, leather, tart grapes, wood. Medium body with a medium acidity and a medium woody and fruity tartness. The flavor starts acidic with citric notes, some vinegar, wood, wherry, tart grapes, unripe gooseberries and berry peel. Finishes dry and woody with more sherry. Good amount of acidity but still smooth with intense and very well integrated sherry notes. Delicious smell! Very good!

Once the beer breathes a few minutes, the aroma is unbelievable! Sherry, young cheese, juicy stone fruits, grapes, horse blanket, some curry, wood, some citrus. So rich and complex!

Medium, a bit oily mouthfeel, with a moderate carbonation. Finishes smooth, medium dry, a bit musty, wooden, fruity, with moderate sherry, green apple skin, citrus, some grapes, slight cheesy funk.

Wow! As the beer was breathing a few minutes it was perfect, so rich and deep, with beautiful sherry and almost a bit juicy fruit notes. Especially the nose was simply amazing!

3 Fonteinen Zenne y Frontera,"(1, 73)",4.9,"W ramach świętowania 4000 różnych wypitych piw :) Piwo kompletne, niezwykle złożone, bogate. Cudowna praca beczki, niesamowite, bardzo skórzaste bretty. Bardzo dojrzałe, jak kilkunastoletnie piwo, a nie butelkowane ledwie 2 lata temu z kawałkiem. Tu jest po prostu wszystko. Cudowne, owocowo-skórzaste bretty, potężne czerwone owoce, dębina, genialne taniny, po ogrzaniu w smaku wychodzą cudowne orzechy laskowe. Być może najbardziej niezwykły i złożony lambik jaki piłem. Jedno z najlepszych piw w życiu. Zakochałem się."

Lakto mocno zaznaczone w smaku, tutaj już mamy owoce jak agrest, skórki winogron, skórka limonki, przebija się beczka i nuta kwaśnych wiśni, mokra skóra, zagroda. W tyle troszkę octu winnego, ziemi. Posmak długi, lakto, beczka, taniny, winogrona. Piękne piwo. Dziękuję Pan Grzegorz Korcz za możliwość doświadczenia tego gueuze."

Pale, honey-tangerine colored body shows high clarity and an off-white head that is large but falls rapidly to cover/ring.
After decanting this bad boy, the first aroma notes are all sherry. Nutty, earthy, woody and with a bit of anise, it’s much more given to the sherry, than lambic. But after about 30 minutes, things start to get very interesting...Gone is the hard, nutty, nearly papery sherry character and in it’s place is a ton of funky brett, with lime, hickory nut skin, band aid and black pepper. Sherry notes become more vinous, oily and leathery, still retaining the nuttiness but becoming softer; much softer. Light vanilla, honey and a hint of tobacco, perhaps? Seems like you could sit and sniff this stuff, as it evolves, for hours....
The flavor is bright, full of brett, with perfectly integrated sherry notes of butter toffee, orange blossom honey and pecan. Acidity adds balance without overpowering and a delicate, wondrous balance is achieved. Malty-soft texture with low, but tight carbonation and no alcohol or flaw. Lingering orange blossom, honey-cashew and lambic-derived acidity. Stunning.
Blend 53 750mL at Tørst, 4/30/23.
Pale sherry. Clear, small, white head.
Rich buttered bread, almond, cashew, zippy sherry-like grape acidity on the end. Funk, Brett, mild lactic acidity.
Big sherry, this one is particularly peppery and dry with massive black pepper. Peach, plum, Brett, more funk. Soft, malty body, good depth and attenuation. Still pretty good damned stunning!"

3 Fonteinen Zenne y Frontera,"(2, 7)",4.9,"Zenne, B 1, 160710 - decanted

Pours darker than a regular Lambic, possibly resulting from the Sherry barrels, with a a dark orange, almost brown color and a nice, fluffy head.

The aromas are full of toasty cherry pits and dusty, moldy oak with a well nuanced, boozy hint to it, gently balanced by a blend of fruity cherries and crisp lemon peel. Cherries got a profound sugary sweetness coming from the barrel, almost a little spicy at its peak, convincingly toned down by the wooden barrel. Got a yellow grape acidity and ripeness to it, lending an additional layer of matured, fermented fruit sweetness to the nose.

Has a lower carbonation with a velvet, fuller mouthfeel featuring a great interplay of the Cherry barrel and 3F’s typical bright funky- and sourness.

Tastes of a mineral, stony beginning, inviting old cherry pits to the palate, which got a toasty, sugar glazed quality to them. A sour undertone takes up on the cherry flavor and adds crisp lemon peel to it, enhancing its appearance without getting exceedingly acidic at any point. The barrel also adds musty, wooden funk with a fermented wine characteristic to the taste, showcasing the bigger body of this. Reveals a sour, fermented Cherry taste with lots of wood and flowery citrus - sour and dry, while staying surprisingly fruity during the finish. 

Probably the most complex Lambic I’ve had so far. Armand did create a blend no one else thought of, and he did it tremendously well. All flavors, led by the prominent Cherry barrel, blend harmoniously together, showcasing an amazing interplay of wood, funk, sweet and sour. Everything you could wish for in a Lambic, you’ll find it here."

Condensed oloroso sherry like oakiness lies on the aroma like a lid, with a distinct touch of that earthy, near-mushroom funk. Mirabelles, vanilla and apple brandy merge in flavour while remaining exquisetely, bone-dry. Warrants its higher abv, creating a powerful interplay of musty grape skins, dried raisins, wood and old lemons in the back. Quite extravagant, sadly overhyped and hence limited 3F brew I was happy enough to try a sample of, even if I prefer shades of dried, pickled and moroccan lemon rind in my geuzes and lambieks over grape and sherry."

Aroma is really what stands out with the beer as there’s everything great you usually find in the best 3F gueuzes with a beautiful mineral funk and peppermint notes but it’s beautifully enhanced by the oxidized wine character bring another layer of minerality, dust, mushrooms and oak. Wonderfully complex. Taste is pretty good, but definitely not as stellar as the aroma. It’s moderately acidic, never too much though, with nice funk again, dust, mushrooms, mineral notes, maple syrup notes, mild meaty presence and oak. Medium body. Very soft carbonation. Quite vinous. Oaky and dusty finish. Another amazing 3F beer. I would love to have a few bottles of this to see how it ages. Wonderful aroma and nice choice of barrels to age 3F gueuze."

First nose is fruity sherry with that distinct 3 Fonteinen funk. Later noses get woodier and deeper in vanilla tones. Beautiful foam and mouthfeel: full, deep flavors and textures throughout the palate. A fantastic beer, likely one of the finest 3 Fonteinen I’ve had the pleasure of drinking so shortly after release.

Appearance is just what i’d expect from a Geuze, cloudy golden yellowish with a moderate but steady head. 


Aroma : apples, touch of vanilla, funky. 


Flavour : i don’t get any specific crazy flavours like some people do.
I do taste how amazingly balanced and rounded it is.
carbonation is perfect, level of sourness is perfect and u get hints of sweetness ( my guess is from the barreld ) along with some fruityness in the end, especially if you let this one air up for a while in a decanter.

Flavour starts with nicely sour acidic wine grape and lemon, sherry vinegar notes, oak, hay, earthy dusty funk. Develops into a sweet/tart finish with emergence of more sherry, with yellow raisins and other dried pit fruit, walnuts, vanilla hints, and yet more oak. The aftertaste of sherry characters lasts for several minutes (I timed it!). Smooth and medium-full bodied for a lambic with soft but filling carb. The choice of barrel is inspired, the lambic as good as expected and the execution stunning. Next level.

3 Fonteinen Zenne y Frontera,"(2, 81)",4.5,"Plusieurs verres de dégustation, le tout décanté, pendant les journées portes ouvertes à 3F.

Couleur orangée restant assez claire, col crémeux et persistant blanc-cassé.
Arôme fait de suite offre d’une certaine intensité de barrique qui met en avant la complexité du PX. Ce bouquet est épais et allie le bouquet distinct de Sherry avec le bouquet de lambic, à savoir des effluves finement citronnées, note d’aigreur qui reste assez minime.


En bouche, je suis également pris par surprise au niveau de l’intensité du produit. Le tout reste marqué à 7% et semble paraitre plus. Le profil garde une certaine longueur sèche des lambics qui s’adoucit avec le murissage dans ces barriques pour offrir un savant alliage entre un lambic aux teneurs de funk(léger), citronné, cuire et léger terreux avec le boisé du Sherry qui confère un petit côté noisette, pointe de vanille et léger vineux. Sur la fin, je note tout de même une pointe aigrelette qui s’immisce dans ce profil chaleureux et me rappeler que je suis au Pajotenand.


Le profil évolutif du carafage - Armand parlait de décantation mais je n’ai pas vu cela lors du versage des bouteilles malgré la présence de la bougie et que dire du possible dépôt? - était déjà marqué lors de mon 2ième verre qui était rempli d’une Zenne fraichement décantée. Le profil tout comme le bouquet n’étaient pas aussi ouvert que le 1er. 



Un produit d’exception qui trouvera certainement, et vu son prix, son public et dont le coût peut être sujet de débat. Ce n’est clairement pas pour toutes les bourses, et il faut espérer que les non-initiés connaisseurs de vin à qui semble s’adresser ce produit fassent la transition vers cette bière et les tables des grands restaurants. On s’éloigne déjà du côté attractif qui fait de la bière un produit disponible pour tous mais qui vaut néanmoins d’être dégustée, ce que les journées portes ouvertes permettent de faire."

It is very much 3F but the oak presence is huge & reveals the spirits previously stored in them. Very dry beer with huge amount of oak lingering. The wood gives it some bitterness, lingering wine oak, very dry with some sherry, tad sour with an almost light vinegar feel to it (new for a 3F geuze for me), lightly puckering, big dried peach presence, faint almost Turkish delight, 3F white pepper & funk are huge, the wood really lingers, adding almost more wine than sherry-like feel to it, touch stone fruit, huge dry character & oak. Really lingers. I really like it but I feel like I would be blown away if I loved wine as well or if I just loved wine.

Might as well just copy and paste the above remarks. Barrel really shines in this beer and hides what makes Dark Lord a meh beer. Dark fruits, chocolate, vanilla, coconut, caramel and other fun notes.

Lots of chocolate and roast with balanced barrel character. Light coconut and vanilla from the barrels. Moderate bourbon note but not too hot. 
Pours black with a small thick mocha head. Moderate legs and no lacing. 
Flavor is similar to aroma and is super decadent with nice bourbon balance in the finish. 
Mouthfeel is full bodied with low carbonation. Low astringency and medium alcohol spice. 
Overall it’s a fan good stout but not tons better than others."

splited it at home ( as part of my 2 day - during doomsday-drink ( some pretty insane stuff, just becouse why not ! ) with 77 ships ( and another guy, dont know if he’s on rb) 
it pours black , no visual foam
the smell is bourbon, sweetness ( damn even sweeter than the basebeer) 
taste is ... sweetness ( sugary from the dark lord) bourbon ( damn much of it ! ) vanilla, caramel, syrupy comes to mind, even though i dont think this is very thick in substance, its just very heavy in the stomach ( to me that it, maybe i shouldnt have drank this after so many other goodies) 
the alcohol is definetly there, but not TOO much. carbo is very low ( gotta love that) overall a very sweet, maximized bourbon taste kind of beer. not realy my thing ( as expected ) yet i stil REALY wanted to try this ( the fuzz thats going on, and lets face it, i can no longer denie i like to hunt a whale now and than :p ) it kinda lives up to my expectations, but its also nothing more than that.

i would like to thank bobochamp very very much for this beer , i otherwise would have been searching for god knows how long. and now i dont have to give up 3 testikles for it ! 
hope this makes a good doomsday/holiday gift eugene !"

Pours a dark brown mocha black (first time, I probably describe the actual colour of a beer as opposed to the head as mocha), the head itself doesn’t exist & it is forgiven. Smell is incredible thick, solid syrupy molasses bourbon, thick dark fruits & brown sugar, huge wood vanilla, thick sludgy caramel, sticky huge bourbon, milk chocolate, very sweet creamy coffee, thick pure chocolate brownies, rum cake,… ridiculous, bloody brilliant. Taste is thick sticky molasses, pure chocolate brownies, rum cake, huge bourbon, incredible amounts of wood vanilla which is basically the great thing about bourbon, I am still astonish as to just how much wood vanilla fine bourbon can have on its own, it is a flavour I never fully picked up or got the description until I tried decent bourbon, thick syrup, even more huge bourbon, very thick syrupy dark fruits, creamy milk chocolate, very creamy, dark fruit syrup, toffee, plums, sweet, sweetness covers the huge alcohol, towards the end I did feel the alcohol burn my throat, I still didn’t taste it, if you really warm up the beer, you can smell some alcohol. If you take a Big sip, you get some light bitter roasted malts in the back, otherwise just this uniform brilliant sweetness. Very silky, smooth, creamy syrupy mouthfeel with pretty much no carbonation. People can say what the like about these huge boozy sweet RIS being rated so highly & I do really, really understand them most of the time but this is simply divine. The taste is very uniform, sweet combo of the previously mentioned flavors. Now this is a rare beer I really wish I could easily get hold of, unavailability is the only downside. Hype or whatever, didn’t expect this to be so brilliant the first time around & second time, getting a nicer, lovelier portion it just proves itself again.

The barrels don’t destroy the base Dark Lord at all, but rather build and re-direct this into a new beast. A special treat this is. Great beer.

I shared this bad boy at the Star Wars tasting. 750 ml waxed bottle, 567/688, served in a Deschutes tulip.

A: Pours a dark black color, viscous like motor oil. A nice ring mocha foam is left over after the pour. As it recedes and swishes around there is some nice legs and splotchy lace left behind.

A: Bourbon up front with some dark fruits. smooth oak, some caramel, milk chocolate sweetness and nice toasted malts.

T: Nice barrel presence right away. Smooth bourbon, smoked oak, caramel and light vanilla. Sweet chocolate, some fudge and roasted malts. Toasted marshmallow as well. Very well integrated.

M: Thick and chewy. Medium to low carbonation. So smooth and it goes down with some slight heat.

O: This is drinking really, really well right now. No harsh booze and the barrel is just integrated very well. My personal favorite of the day.

Black syrupy pour, so thick it truly does look like 50,000-mile motor oil! Aroma is intense and sets my mouth watering: fresh tiramisu, chocolate, bourbon. Sticky, thick, hearty palate that is densely flavoured to reflect the nose: fresh tiramisu, bourbon-toffee sauce, hot fudge, vanilla, woody and earthy undercurrents. Boozy and warming, but smooth as silk. I wondered whether this would be worthy of the hype or whether it is inflated by rarity. It is worthy of its accolades and deserving of its status.

This beer is so vivid, so delicious, it’s like brownie concentrate with caramel, nuts, syrup. Body is full and soft, unlike the oily chore that is regular Dark Lord.

2010 vintage, served side by side with Dark Lord and Vanilla Bean Dark Lord.

Oak Aged Dark Lord pours a near jet black, with hints of brown visible at the upper edges of the glass when held to the light. Head and lacing are somewhat subdued, but given the serving medium, I couldn’t ask for more. A great big aroma of rich roasted malt and oak barrels. Wow. Dark Lord is one of my favorite beers, and I find the addition of oak barrels to be quite wonderful. There is a prominent licorice note in the taste. Someone described the feel as ""oil slick in the gulf"" and I have to agree. Thick and chewy, this beer leaves a coating of stout residue in your mouth that utterly blankets the palate. This is remarkably smooth, given the high alcohol (it is higher this year than previous vintages), and gives a nice, warm burn as it slides down. I really hope I can go to DLD next year and get some of this fresh from the tap.

Pint in a plastic glass at darklord day. Dark viscous black with a nice creamy mocha head. This was like dark lord on steroids. Lots of booze, oak, vanilla, chocolate. I really felt that this overwhelmed the original version - and at least the vanilla bean version balanced things out. Definitely a full body, no idea on the carbonation since the mouthfeel was highly viscous, like motor oil, sweet and alcohol on the palate, long lasting but quite powerful finish. I know that people love this beer, and maybe its become more balanced over time, or maybe newer versions are just better, but I actually gave away parts of both cups I got during the fest because I just found them to be overwhelming - and this was after I had been sampling beer for 4 hours! O well."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 74)",3.9,"This sample was a Heaven Hill.  Very dark.  Smells like cat kibble.  Bleh. Tastes rich, whiskeyish, balanced with super roasty character and lots of sweet malts.  Intense."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 75)",4.4,"Lucky to taste this at CCB Hunahpu Day. Great Beer.  Medium to heavy body, extremely sweet with flavors of RICH woody Bourbon/Chocolate flavor, toasty vanilla and some raisin. GREAT GREAT GREAT stout. However, not worth the crazy prices on Ebay in my opinion."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 76)",4.3,"On draft at CCB Hunahpu release day 2012. This was one of my top wants for a while. Nose is oak and bourbon with some cocoa, raisins, and a touch of booze. Nice. Pour was black with a tan head. Taste is similar with big notes of oak and chocolate. Sweet and delicious with a light dark fruit and booze follow-up. I like this one a lot. Cheers!!"
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 77)",4.1,"On Tap @ CCB for Hunahpu’s Day. Pours jet black with a little brown lacing. Very oaky, boozy aroma. This drinks quite smooth, oaky, a bit of vanilla and extremely sweet. Enjoyable but not sure its consumable in large quantities."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 78)",4.6,"What a treat @ Hunahpu’s day. This one pours a rich black body with an off-white head. The aroma is incredibly complex; coffee, wood vanilla, raisins, cocoa, dirt, licorice and alcohol. The taste is a little more straightforward - rich and roasted but with some dried fruits coming down to a subtle oak and vanilla finish. Delicate, yet heavy given the abv. Just about f*cking perfect."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 79)",4.3,"Pours unclear dark black with a beautiful creamy caramel head. The aroma is sweet with some vanilla oak notes smooth in the nose. The flavors of roasted malts, coffee, and sweet booze from the barrels come in so nicely on a medium to thick just body."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 80)",4.8,"Reviewed from notes the day after DLD ’11.  I actually enjoyed this beer today at the brewpub. They still had one keg left when they opened this morning. The menu said that it was 2010 DL aged for one year in Heaven Hill bourbon barrels. The nose was of sweet chocolate, vanilla, and light bourbon. The vanilla and bourbon were predominant but neither was overpowering. The flavors were nice and superbly well meshed. The chocolate and bourbon finished quite well together. It was exceptionally smooth, perfect in body. This beer was fantastic."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 81)",3.8,"On tap at GTMW 2011, pours black with a thin head and spotty lacing, aroma is pretty similar to the regular Dark Lord with just a touch of bourbon on the nose, the flavor has a decent amount of chocolate on the front end with a bourbon kick in the finish, still a little too sweet for me just like the other variations I’ve had, good, but not my favorite Imperial Stout by far."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 82)",4.3,"Heaven Hill version poured at GTMW.  Light bourbon and vanilla, background roasted malt, sweet cream, and mild fruitiness.  Light barrel flavors, roasted malt background, sweet maltiness and sugar.  Velvet on the palate.  Prefer about as much as the original with just a slight edge to the addition of barrel flavors."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 83)",3.9,"On tap.  Very dark black pour, little carbonation and a noticeable (but not overpowering) bourbon nose.  Flavor was similar to some of the recent years of Dark Lord, very slick and sweet chocolate and a nice bourbon aftertaste which really finished off the aftertaste nicely.  Good beer, but there are other BB RIS out there which can come close to this(and are more readily available)."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 84)",3.7,"got this in a mix pack of various BA dark lords from my local grocery store. i’m not really sure what all this obsession is with this style. it’s sorta like hey let’s take a stout and make it stronger but not really in all aspects and then throw it in a barrel? and what does imperial even mean? like it was in standard US measurements and then they just changed it to imperial? anyway i’m not amazed but compared to the others in this mix pack it aint half bad. i thought the barrel was there and it was kinda sweet but hey it’s bourbon right?1 it’s like a mix of things you know? like hey this is a stout and not that great but then some bourbon and you know it’s alright. some of the other ones in my mix pack were better but i will still drink this one down, i’m not afraid or anything. i can’t believe I even found this in a mix pack you know? better than the sam adams but not by much, and I prefer the magic hat by a small margin. next time try something a little different, ok 3 floyds?



(real rating)

8/13/11. On tap at the GTMW. Hugely sweet bourbon barrel aroma with some fudge, sour, and coconut. Overly sweet bourbon barrel flavor with coconut  vanilla, and lingering roast. Good, but you can definitely taste the rare. Overly sweet."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 85)",4.7,"So i got this at Three Floyds last year at DLD, man that wait to get in was forever. Worth the drive though.
My snifter arrived and i was excited, the bourbon added  a depth to darklord i didn’t know was possible, integrated and warming on top of an already rich chocolate and coffee stout massacre."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 86)",3.8,"Heaven Hill version on tap at Hunahpu’s Day.  Wow, this is my favorite version of Dark Lord to date.  Velvety chocolate nose.  Thick Joan Jett black pour with a dark chocolate head.  Simply delicious with all kinds of sweet chocolate, mellow bourbon, dark roasted malts, and caramel notes.  (original rating 4.8)
Re-rate - Bottle ’15.  Sweet sugary mess.  Dark lord has fallen off so much these days.  There are no roasted malt notes left at all.  The bourbon, oak, and vanilla notes from the barrel are stalled up by the sweetness of the beer.  A real shame......"
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 87)",4.6,"Had on tap at Dark Lord Day 2011.

Well worth the wait.

A: Dark with no head just like the others.

S: Damn fine Bourbon bliss!

T: Ok, I tasted the bourbon at first and it was smooth, but after going back and forth between this and the vanilla DL I developed this Graham cracker taste which complemented the vanilla’s marshmallow flavor, unreal!

O: Overall I have to say it was one of the best beer experiences of my life but the vanilla is better if I had to have only one."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 88)",4.7,"Pour is what you would expect, jet black with next to no head. Nose is of bourbon, bourbon, and o yea bourbon. Taste is much the same with some vanilla and other sweet notes on the back side that make it one of the smoothest tasting beers ever had."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 89)",4.7,"Bottle split with Pat, Andrew, Dallas and Bobby. Congrats on Dallas’ engagement. Sampled the bourbon aged DL after a session of 2011, 2010, 2009, and the 2008 vintages. It’s apparent that the Dark Lord improves with age as the sweet notes that were once overpowering become more subdued letting other flavors share the limelight - rich, dark chocolate, cherries, molasses, light tobacco, smoke, and of course coffee notes. With the Bourbon-aging, the DL is perfected. It’s essentially exactly what you’d expect - the flavors have been enhanced with notes of bourbon, sweet oak, earthy wood, one of the greatest beers I’ve ever tried and probably ever will."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 90)",5,"Sessions with James, Dallas, Pat, and Bobby.. Courtesy of James. Thank you so much... This is incredible.    Bourbon is the brightest and best tasting I’ve had... Vanilla, smokey and sweet.  Maple and slightest cherries.  Love at first sip."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 91)",5,"Bottle with only the best of friends. Shout outs to james, pat, andrew and bob. Smell is bourbon with vanilla. No head and thick black pour. Taste is creamy vanilla, alcohol, and slight peppery aftertaste. Incredible brew. Balance is ridiculous. Finishes slightly dirty, lingering, but begging for more tastes. Awesome."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 92)",4.7,Had at DLD 11. Well worth the wait of about an hour to try. Subtle and smooth burbon and a great body
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 93)",4.7,"Apr 30 @ DLD, courtesy of bnutz. Strong barrel and bourbon aroma, more mature and pleasant than the regular one. Flavor is velvety lean and round, tary, roasted, sweet, caramel and alcohol. Balanced and sweet. Finish so good, balanced an matured with burning alcohol aftertaste."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 94)",4.2,"Tasted on draft at DLD2011, this is the 2010 Dark Lord aged for a year in Heaven Hill barrels, my friend Ben brought me a sample from inside the brewpub.  Pours a murky oily black.  By the time it got to me, there was no head whatsoever, but with agitation, it forms a thin collar of tan lace.  The nose is darkly roasted malt, molasses, brown sugar, light coffee, and the vanilla, cinnamon, barrel, and bourbon flavors underlying.  The flavor is lightly sweet up front with vanilla and molasses, moving to the more roasted malt flavor of dark chocolate, and finishing with more vanilla, cinnamon, oak, and whiskey, with no real coffee flavor to speak of.  The body is full, almost cloyingly so, with light carbonation and a long whiskey and oak finish."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 95)",4.6,"Bourbon Barrel 2010 on tap at the FFF pub after DLD.

A: Thick and black. You could use it to lube up an old engine. Slowly dissipating, tan head. Legs like a supermodel.

S: Nice balance of bourbon, malt sweetness and a little coffee hiding in the background.

T: Wonderful balance of all things awesome. Bourbon most certainly played a supporting role in this one. Far less angular that non-BBA 2010, it doesn’t have the eccentric bitter bite that it’s little brother has. Nice boozy warmth and plenty of fig, coffee and toffee. Delicious.

M: Thick enough to brush your teeth with. Very low carbonation. The time in the barrel and this being a year old now make it nice and smooth.

O: I’m very impressed with this one. I was lucky enough to be at the brew pub right when they opened the day after DLD. It allowed me to really dissect this one without the craziness of the previous day’s festivities surrounding me.

If you’re ever in a situation in which you can try this guy out, take advantage of it. This was magical beer."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 96)",4.4,"Pours black with a very light tan head. Aroma is bourbon,  coffee and dark fruits. Taste is chocolate, dark fruits and booze. This is an awesome beer, but could use a little bit more age."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 97)",3.9,"DLD’11, looks like this years was the 2010 version aged for a year in Heaven Hill barrels., according to the tap site.  Thick black pour, thin to no tan head.  Aroma was boozy, with notes of bourbon, coffee, dark fruit and some slight chocolate.  Taste has notes of hot bourbon, booze, with notes of vanilla and chocolate, some sweet dark fruit and some roast.  Pretty good, definitely too hot at this point and would benefit from some age."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 98)",4.4,"I had this on tap at dl into a 12oz plastic cup. The beer is black as expected with a medium tan head. The aroma is nice with the oak dominating the front, nice notes of vanilla and sweet chocolate. The taste is also lots of oak but not overpowering or annoying. It really adds a lot to the original dl but not quite as good as the vanilla."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 99)",4,"Old notes from DLD 08.  This beer was great, but only a little better than the 08 darklord.  Aroma and appearance were hurt by plastic cups.  Similar to the standard darklord expect a hair more boozey...noticeable bourbon."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 100)",4.4,"#900. Nip handbottle courtesy a great RB trade partner. Pours completely pitch black, thick, and viscous that lets barely any light though. The body is topped by a small patch of dark brown bubbles with no lace to speak of, but the drippy sheeting stains the glass nicely. The aroma is really decadent and complex with soft whiskey and oak laden vanilla all atop a nice blend of burnt caramel malt, dark chocolate, and mocha coffee. Hints of star anise adds some nice balancing spice. This thing just smells fantastic. The flavor follows and maybe not quite as impressive as the nose, but still fantastic with notes of dark chocolate cake, burnt caramel, roasted coffee followed by the whiskey boozy influence. The anise adds some nice spice, and the oak imparts its signature vanilla character. Full bodied, dense, and oily, but slightly thinned from regular Dark Lord and very minimal carbonation no doubt due to the hand bottling. Roasted coffee and bourbon soaked oak linger on the finish. It is still signature Dark Lord, but the barrel really adds great depth and a nice bourbon influence. Awesome beer."

The nose on this beast is incredible. Incredible sweet and sour blackberries and raspberries hits the nose, lots of sweet sticky forest fruits with some dusty basement funk. It’s like i am smelling freshly picked fruits. Taste follows the nose. Lots of sweet blackberries upfront with sweet raspberries, marmelade, and right after that the sourness hits your jaws. A bit to carbonated, but that’s not a game changer on this beast. This is one hell of a beer that lived the hype all the Way. And as a belgian sour this is very hard to say.

I’ve got to give it up to Grant & Royce for their efforts in getting this beer to my dome, thanks bros.



The beer pours a deep reddish purple with a small head and good lacing on the glass.



The aroma is very fruity with seedy berries, some miild woodiness, some light funkiness and a whole lot of berries... Honestly it’s fairly sweet smelling. 



The flavor is loads of tart fruit, seedy berries, lemon, black raspberries... some citrus rind. The beer is very tart & plenty sour, dry and decently oaky. The fruit character is just massive but not without allowing for some of the funkiness of the fermentation to harmonize. 



Exceeding in my expectations, on all accounts one of the masterpieces of this brewery."

Ruby with a huge strawberry milkshake head, dense and lasting, solid lacing. Ultra jammy aroma hits the nose from across the room, huge depth, cobweb, tons of sour blackberry flesh, skin captured too. Sour flavor still has ton of tons of fruit, incredible depth, slightly bitter arsenic/rubber that grows with warmth, high co2 bitterness, acidity high but soft and supremely jammy through the lightly watery finish, would prefer a stickier end but this is absolutely delicious. Fantastic blackberry beer, far and away #1 against all others with the sour depth an added bonus. That it all works together seals the deal, fantastic integration.

This one though? This one doesn’t just beat those beers. It mops the floor with them.

I couldn’t believe how much blackberry flavor was packed into this sour, but it shouldn’t have been a surprise to me given how masterful New Glarus has proven itself to be when it comes to brewing with fruit. What else can I say about this beer that hasn’t already been said? It is the best sour I’ve ever had in my life. Period."
New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(1, 39)",4.5,"500 ml bottle


What better beer to celebrate someone’s birthday and another milestone (2900 ratings) than a new rating from the mind of Dan Carey? A world class sour beer, I am glad I have another tucked away in the cellar. It has held up well this last year though if you have any reason at all to crack it open with friends then enjoy this before the next one hits in a few weeks.



Aroma / Appearance - A deep ruby red base sticks to the glass with little effort. Flat with no obvious carbonation this has the vibe of an aged lambic. Blackberries, aggressive vinegar, and other acidic aspects are almost as sharp as a bottle of vintage La Folie. Despite that the fruitiness keeps it from being just a sour bottle of salad dressing.



Flavor / Palate - Blackberry syrup and vinegar poured over a fresh pie fills the mouth with a chewy texture. Not content to just scour the palate clean it then lingers in the throat like an army of scrubbing bubbles leaving a sour mark behind. There are no flaws to be found with this except that the bottle is only 500 ml. Once again New Glarus has proven that they are seldom mistaken with a recipe. I can’t wait to try the 2014 sour in just a few weeks."
New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(1, 40)",4,"Bottle, thnx to Kermis. Pours a deep purple reddish headless beer, slightly murky. Aroma of raspberries, strawberries, blackberries, basically loads and loads of red fruits. Flavor is medium sour, very fruity, cherries, sour apples. A real fruit explosion going on. Soft carbonation, slight watery mouthfeel. Long, dry and sour aftertaste. This really is sour fruit, exceptional, stuff."
New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(1, 41)",4.5,"Big thanks to Motherbrother and Emil for bringing this. Pours hazy dark red with a pinky purple head. Oh boy oh boy the aroma! THE AROMA!! Tons of fruity berry notes along with some sour lactobacillus. Lots of blackberry notes coming along with other sour berries. I get a weak note of rhubarb, fruit yogurt, fruit jam and lots of forrest fruit in general. Very tart and orgasmic aroma! The taste is very tart and with lots of blackberries, fruit sorbet, fruit jam, lactobacillus, weak vinegar/balsamic notes and some c-vitamin. Fok this is refreshing! Amazing beer! 

Had this again thanks to bursprak. This beer is amazing! Same rating as last time!"
New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(1, 42)",4.9,"3 oz pour at bottle share, thanks Shea!
Appearance: Light foam which left slight trails around the glass. Dark purple coloration reminiscent of blackberry juice. Very inviting.
Aroma: Wow. One of the most aromatic beers I have ever enjoyed. Big blackberry aroma wafts out of the glass. There’s no synthetic smell here, its as if hundreds of blackberries were freshly squeezed and jammed into the bottle!
Taste: The flavor progression on this sour is both amazing and surprising. You get an obscenely fresh blackberry flavor on the front while the tartness builds through the middle and climaxes on the finish. In contrast, many sours which I have had blast you with sour on the start and give the fruit flavor on the finish. The sour finish is fairly intense, reminiscent of warhead candy. This flavor is so fresh and spot on I actually had the sensation of phantom blackberry seeds!
Palate: Medium body, very effervescent, bubbly all the way down the palate.
Overall: This is hands down my favorite sour that I have ever had. I was heartbroken when I reached the end of my pour. I just kept breathing in the (still extremely pungent!) aroma from the last vestiges of this sweet nectar of the gods. Well done New Glarus, well done."

Oh jeeeez, the aroma. So much black berry, blueberry, raspberry, rhubarb, smoothie, sorbet, slight yeasty sourness. Huge aroma that fills the entire room. Taste is extremely tart, with of course lots of blackberries, but lots of rhubarb and raspberry as well. Unripe berries in general, almond, Tastes really healthy! Balsamico, dry wood.

Aroma was incredibly bright blackberries, lgiht lemon, and mild funky oaky notes. Flavor was pretty straight forward, but I wouldnt want it any other way, fairly tart, but in the back, sourness does not cover the super fresh and jammy blackberry notes, The perfect balance of fruit and sour. New Glarus needs to sour their other fruits, please!"

New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(1, 64)",4.3,"Cloudy, murky, headless body. Super jammy aroma reminds me of SHBRL. 



Puckering tartness starts things off. Dark fruits, intense sourness, viscous body, blackberry deliciousness abound. 



Significantly different (and better) than every other NG fruited sour. Definitely uses different yeast. Wow."
New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(1, 65)",4.4,"Served in a New Glarus flute. Pours a beautiful bright purple with a touch of pink. Lively carbonation with a pink head. Strong aroma of ripe blackberry and lactic acidity plus a bit of lemon and earth. Lightly funky on the palate after a strong fruit presence. Blackberry plus some mild skin, almost like a cherry or grape skin. Fairly light and extremely refreshing. Lactic character is fairly strong, but without going too far. The best American fruited wild that I’ve had."
New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(1, 66)",4.6,"Bottle from New Glarus. Held onto this for several months to allow it to fully carbonate. Almost panicked when it foamed over! Not quite a gusher, but definitely lost an ounce or so of beer! Gah!! After it settled, it poured a deep maroon, purple hues, 3 finger pink head that slowly worked its way down the glass. Spongy foam into a fine ring of lacing around the glass. The nose is delightful and inviting. Instantly reminded me of the raspberry drop candies (Les Framboises) that my grandma had in the dish on her table. Lots of smashed berry, jam, jelly, syrup, a wafting tartness and mild bread notes. Taste is almost, almost as good as the smell. I was kind of hoping for a bit thicker of a mouth feel, if only to let the flavors/smell resonate on my palate a bit longer! The carbonation is very fine and rushes strong flavors of blackberry/raspberry left and right. Very tart too! The berry sweetness naturally balances the lacto and ends in a very nice harmony. Dry finish. Kind of abrupt...again, selfishly wanting the flavors to linger a bit longer. But, only because those flavors are so wonderful! Fantastic fruited sour. New Glarus is on point!!"
New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(1, 67)",4.5,"VSB - Pour is deep blood maroon with a light purple head. Nose is very simple with a huge blast of the blackberry in a pie filling type aroma with hints of lacto. It really is very sour, blackberry jelly and very bright. Hints of oak come through with faint touch of lacto. Good carbonation an huge puckering dryness. Intense stuff, very well done."
New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(1, 68)",3.9,"Bottle generously shared by Colin. Murky crimson pour with a pinkish head. Big berry aromas. Big black and raspberry notes. Mild vinegar with a hint for caramel malts. Not overly complex. Sour with an above average mouthfeel. Good body. Not really a show stopper, but I understand the hoopla as blackberry is not that common."
New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(1, 69)",3.9,"Bottle... This beer rocks!... Murky crimson ale with small, fizzy, off-white head. Smells like the blackberry cobbler my mom made with the blackberrries I picked from the woods in Arnold, MO when I was a kid - vanilla and graham notes. Medium to full-bodied with an astringent mouthfeel and stinging carbonation. The flavor is fruity and both sour and bitter - blackberries (seeds and all). The flavor is all about the blackberries. Finishes coarse, sour and bone-dry. Kudos to ctipping for sharing this beer with the south Florida crew!"
New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(1, 70)",4.5,"Bottle - pours a blood red with medium carbonation. Smells of Blackberries, raspberries, and currants. The smell is great. The taste is fruity and sour. It's freaking great. 

---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"
New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(1, 71)",3.7,"So the carbonation problem has resolved itself; New Glarus asked to hold on to these for a couple months to fully carbonate, and it did. A soft pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a glass filling, four-finger thick, pink head that has me sucking down foam so that it doesn’t over flow; the foam tastes incredibly tart, with a hugely floral, over-ripe berry fruit character. The beer went into the fridge yesterday with a beer you could see through even through the brown glass; today, through the glass the beer shows a bunch of chill haze. The beer is a murky, dark cherry color that shows a deeply hazed, lighter cherry hue when held up to the light. The foam has a lot of structure to it, and sticks to the sides of my glass quite thickly. The rich, tart, dark fruit character is incredibly bright and dominant here; it reminds me of dark, complex cherries, and raspberries. This is supported by light notes of grassy, perhaps seed derived, fruit character, perhaps a hint of musty phenolics in the finish, and when you really dig for it, just a hint of plastic / medicinal like character in the long finish.



I made the mistake of giving my wife a sip of this, and she immediately demanded to have me pour some in her own glass. The beer is tart up front, and doesn’t let up through the finish; the tartness gets a touch harder, with a bit more sour edge towards the middle and finish, and it gets mixed in with a medicinal note that reminds me of something like cherry-flavored children’s aspirin. The fruit character is definitely dominant here, and provides notes of dark, sour cherries (leans towards the richness in Schaerbeekse type cherries), incredibly floral (fruity rose and carnation notes), and dark, concentrated raspberry notes. A bit of nutty malt like character comes through after a bit and adds a nice bit of complexity that is not fruit related. Touches of berry seed like notes, meld with a nutty, slightly woody oak character in the finish. A fresh, berry like pulp character is noticeable towards the finish, it really reminds me of chewing on the ripest (though not sweet), incredibly floral and expressive, blackberries one could imagine. The body is nice and rich, yet light and soft at the same time, just as a good Lambic often achieves. The sourness here can be quite biting at times, it definitely leans towards making this a sipping beer. The oak and berry flavors in this beer definitely provide an astringency and bite to the finish as well, though it is more rounded than the bite from the sourness.



This really does approach the richness of the better thought of fruit Lambics; it has the über-fresh, concentrated fruit jam character of a Lou Pepe, or 3F Schaerbeekse, and it is drier, yet still satisfying. This is far better than I was expecting, though it doesn’t have the complexity that I like in a Lambic, though to be fair, New Glarus has not called this a Lambic, and those super fruit bombs from 3F and Cantillon are low on the Lambic flavors as they get drowned out on the fruit for the most part (though not entirely). Really nice, and I wish this was easy enough to get that I had a couple of these in the cellar to enjoy."
New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(1, 72)",4.4,"Very dark pour. Color is dark bluish red if that makes sense. The head is frothy and lasting. The taste is very tart and less candied than expected. Still some notisable sweetness but its ballanced and ’grown up’. Berry freshness and bretty goodness very well combined. If the Packers doesn’t put Wisconsin on the map, this will. Holla!"
New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(1, 73)",4.8,"500 ml bottle. Pours a gorgeous ruby red with a finger of fizzy tinted rose head that settles into an uneven film. Aroma of rich, ripe blackberries and raspberries and cherries, oak, earth, and leather- a ton of nice berry character, though not as sour as anticipated. The flavor is more sour, with the same berries, but more tart than sweet and juicy, with oak, lemon, and grape skins. Light-medium bodied, with medium to sharp carbonation and a sour, crisp mouthfeel that is dry at the end and has lingering tartness. Amazing. Exceeded my extremely high expectations. Transcendent."

Intense jammy, blueberry/blackberry melted popsicle aroma. Taste is similar- bright and yogurty with a LP Kriek and St Lamvinus style of bright purple fruit. Yogurty, bright palate.

New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(1, 97)",4.1,"Yeah baby - thanks to cbfobes for this one! Pours totally cloudy reddish purple with a small pink head that dissipates slowly with good lacing. Aroma is, well, blackberry. Pure and simple. Perhaps a touch of oak in there somewhere, but really just blackberry. Given the aroma, flavor is surprisingly tart, puckering the tongue instantly. There is a bit of initial balancing sweetness as well, but it backs off quickly and dries out big time. Flavors are really blackberry fruit dominated, with some oak, lemon and just a tiny bit of funkiness. Medium body. This is a beer that highlights what New Glarus does best - fruit that tastes like fruit. However, in the end, it really beats hard on just two notes - blackberry and tart, and thus lacks the complexity of the best in class. Still, an interesting and quality beer."

New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(2, 1)",4.8,"Pours to a deep purple maroon body with a rapidly dissipating pink head. A small ring of head remains. Inky body. The aroma is heavy on the blackberry. Almost reminds me of some of those naked brand fruit drinks this is so fruity. The flavor is strong with blackberry. Very tart, sour, and has a subtle funk. Almost acidic enough to peel enamel. One says that this is simply sour blackberry, but it is a marvel to get it this sour. Nearing that of cantillon fou fon or rose de Gambrinus. Rich thick and coating body."
New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(2, 2)",4.7,"Aroma: blackberries and jam burst from the bottle immediately after popping the cap. Massive blackberry nose, nice crisp acidity, pleasant earthy funkiness, no malt character to speak of, nice hints of oak and vanilla.
Appearance: pours a dark purple color, somewhat hazy, massive pink head which dissipates to a lasting ring after a minute or two.
Taste: As the aroma would indicate, a very bold wave of blackberries hits first. Blackberries and jam are followed by a bright acidity - fairly sour, not puckering or as sour as some Lambics, but getting up there. Lemon and some tangy grapefruit notes, red wine, hints of oak and vanilla. There’s certainly some earthiness and funk going on, tough the fruit and acidity remain at the focus throughout the taste. 
Palate: light-medium body - just enough that the beer doesn’t feel thin. Spritzy carbonation, dry and acidic finish. 
Overall: really great sour beer, easily one of my favorites from either side of the pond thus far. Great fruit character, superbly complex and drinkable. Excellent!"
New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(2, 3)",4.7,"500 ml. Picked up upon release 10th in line on Friday had a great conversation with Dan and with Bob (skyview) Gusher lots of carbonation the pour is flat purple with a pinkush purple Hugh head that dissipates quickly with aromas of blackberries,funk and lots descriptive words that really have no place in my rating, the taste is sour BlackBerry funk, be careful how you drink this, the funky lacto sourness can set you back in your seat, the fruitness is right on I grow blackberrys in the garden and they tend to be more sour than sweet which helped with the overall sourness...damn I wish I went back on Saturday before the great taste and Sunday when heading home, one of the best sours I have had deserving of the gold it won at the GABF"
New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(2, 4)",4.1,"500ml bottle from the brewery. Pours a deep, reddish-purple color with a big pink head that fades to pink bubbles around the edge of the glass. Aroma is fruity, blackberries, raspberries, blackberry jam. Medium on the palate with lively carbonation. Flavor is sour, light blackberry, some oak, some sour yeastiness, just a touch of vanilla, tart raspberry, with a tart, fruity finish. This beer smells amazing right now, which I’m sure will fade with time. Easily one of the best fruited Lambic style beers made in America. Also the best of the R&D series to date for me. I can wait to see where New Glarus’ sour/lambic-style program goes from here."

A: What a color. Pours a deep purple color with a pinkish colored head. It recedes to a thin ring. Some splotches of lace down the glass.

S: Super jammy on the nose. The initial blast of sweet blackberry jam is intense, but it quickly gives way to a sweet bread malt profile with a splash of sour fruit and oak.

T: Not as jammy on the taste, but it it is still there. Ultra fresh blackberries with some nice under ripe berry tartness. Oaky with slight vanilla sweetness to it. Light, bready malts with a nice blackberry sourness.

M: medium to light bodied with a spritzy carbonation level. Effervescence on the tongue. 

O: Super jammy and sour. Really nice right now. Dan Carey said to wait until Christmas time open bottle so that what I plan on doing. I think the flavors will meld together even better than they already are.

Awesome big blackberry raspberry nose. Tartness perceivable even from just the smell. Really big puckering sour taste, so tasty. Not hard to drink, though. Pretty tasty once you get past the initial sour shock, surprisingly easy to drink. Light, sort of soft carbonation. Sticky in the finish. Freakin’ awesome sour fruit beer.

New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(2, 15)",5,"(8/9/15) Bottle #2. The fresh juiciness of its younger version has evolved into a complex masterpiece. More wild/woody character. Wonderfully tart. Previous rating of 4.7 seems laughable. This couldn’t possibly be better.
(8/28/13). Bottle #1 ’Fresh’. Pours a beautiful dark ruby midnight purple. Large, fluffy pinkish light purple head that reduces to a medium creamy topping and large ring around glass. Aroma of bursting with blackberry along with some other berry aromas (fresh raspberry); sweet, juicy, and fruity with perfect sour note and lightly woody and a little background funk. Medium body. Pleasantly strong sour, tart, woody drying, lasting evenly funky, sour juicy finish. Very rich but not over-the-top. Complex with good balance. Fantastic."
New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(2, 16)",4.5,"Awesome pink head. smells very sweet, no sour really, more just like a tart fruit. Blackberry, blueberry, raspberry....berry. light, sweet, juicy, and fruity. 
Very light, crisp, almost bubbly, like tingly on my tongue. Not nearly as sour as I expected, which I’m happy about, because I’m not a huge sour fan. Starts a little tart, gets smoother, has a little kick at the end. A little drying, but not much. Very sweet, fruity, and delicious."
New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(2, 17)",4.4,"I got this at the brewery, and got to the brewery more or less by accident. So Shout out to Matt for letting me know this bad boy would be released while I was in New Glarus. Pour is a beautiful opaque dark ""ruby"" red, with a huge, fluffy/bubbly dark pink head. 
Aroma is really blackberry forward, sour sweets, light green apples, ascorbic acids, some tart with both ripe and unripe fruits to it as well - Really delicious and complex. 
The taste is really sour, but has some nice fruity sweet notes to it, which really balances this out, the finish to this is dry... Beautiful. 
Medium body, with a rather fizzy and tickling carbonation. 
When drunk fresh, this really is a treat - but can’t wait to see how this matures."

New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(2, 19)",4,"500 ml bottle from one of our stops by New Glarus over GTMW Weekend 2013 (New Glarus, WI). Pours a deep ruby crimson hue, deep seedy berry, good haziness with sizable pinkish red hue atop. Dies to a firm layer, laces well enough. Sticks around as a decent layer. Deep dark body of good berry glow, blackberry and raspberry pulp. Aromas are just heavenly. Rich seedy blackberry, raspberry, and gentle cherry. Pulpy and juicy, memories of Southampton BRL come immediately flowing back. Lemony lactic twang, seedy berry, and yogurt. Some gentle funk works in as it settles and warms. Decent tannic oak hits the nostrils. Very impressive fruit presence, pretty sour on the nose. Initial is firmly sour, not overdone. Lactic and blackberry elements are firm, seedy and yogurt presence. Ripe and pulpy raspberry, oak, and gentle funk. A mellow carbonation in the body, a bit soft but still tart. Time should do this well. Middle is fruity, seedy, a bit more acidity hits but nothing that would be considered overwhelming. A bit prickly still with a firm fruit base. Gentle oak grows, mellow yogurt. Twangy lactic and berry elements mingle firmly. A bit more fruity, gentle berryskin and sugars into the backend. Some time and age will dry this out a bit more, up the carbonation to a really nice level I think. Really nice beer right now, potent but not overdone sourness. A bit flat into the backend and finish as it tapers out, still leaves a firm blackberry presence, seedy with mellow cobwebs, oak, and barnyard. Really see some time upping that backend experience. As it stands, it’s rich and has some really nice elements, especially it’s nose, appearance, and front end. Backend is more like a New Glarus fruit beer but a bit more tart, mellow carbonation. Pretty nice beer. Think I enjoyed Gueuze more. But this could really be the best with a little more time to improve palate score. Nose is just fantastic."
New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry,"(2, 20)",4.2,"Bottle picked up yesterday the brewery release. The brewer said that this beer is still carbonating in the bottle and will be fruitier and less sour now than it will be with some age. he recommended aging at room temperature 70-78 degrees until fall or later. I couldn’t resist and wanted to try it now. This is a 20 ounce bottle poured into a flute. Striking cranberry color with a short lived red head. From a foot away there is a strong berry fruit aroma. Up close all I can think of when I smell it is macerated blackberries and raspberries. Very sweet and fresh fruit fragrance. As told, it is very fruity with some cranberry and lemon flesh tartness and a whisper of funk. The flavor is much more tart than the nose would indicate. High acidity makes it seem to sparkle more than it actually does. The sourness is slight but is the flavor that lasts on the finish. I can see this becoming much more sour as it continues to develop in the bottle."

Taste is really sweet with the berries dominating as in the aroma, spiced with almond and then the honey becoming more prominent after a few more sips. Full bodied with long lasting aftertaste. Wonderful and delicate mead with a fine balance between the berries and the honey.

Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some floral and red grape/grape skin flavors.  It's earthy and sweet, pretty tasty!  Mouthfeel/body is full, it's smooth, coating and easy to drink.  12% ABV is well hidden here.  I think it's a really good mead, but then I've liked all the meads I've had from Schramm's!"

Немного терпкий и танниный, есть черешня и совсем грам косточки от нее, затем как будто яжевика, хотя она не указана в составе, намеки на малину, черная смородина все приукрашивает. Меда очень мало. Очень насыщенно и ярко, как будто выжимка ягодная, совсем немного кислинка как будто присутствует. Цвет красный, но на просвет аж фиолетовые нотки. Вкус как будто дотрагиваешься до облаков рая. Просто блаженная смесь из разнообразных ноток ягод. Прежде всего радует что ощущается черная смородина, она как бы обвалакивает все остальное. Снова черешня, но меньше, а вот малины и яжевики больше, как будто пьешь ягодный сок, если это приминимо. При глотке появляется сладость, весьма большая, скорее всего это мед так дает о себе знать.

Palais est intense au niveau du fruité et baies rouges, retrouve un alliage réussi avec le mielleux, épais et sirupeux mais tenant de belles aigres de cassis et terreuses de framboises et aussi un effet rappelant plus la mûre. Le tout agrémenté d'un fleuri, miel profond.
Schramm's confirme une bonne place sur les hydromels à fruits. Reste à attendre une sorte de méthode traditionnelle à la polonaise."

Loads of berries in here, with cherry, black currant, boysenberry, raspberry, in that order, and a honey base to back it all. Medium-bodied, with a sweet, tangy, fruity mouthfeel. Such depth. So well rounded and nicely balanced without sacrificing intensity. Good grief. Best mead available during my visit. I need to try this one again. I didn't expect to give it a 4.4 and be under the average score. Wow."

Schramm's A Smile of Fortune,"(1, 72)",4.4,"Bottle thanks to Savada. Pours a cloudy dark purple with no head. The aroma is strong berry, currant, grape, honey, booze. Thick, jammy, berry, boozy, sweet cherry, very nice."

Schramm's A Smile of Fortune,"(1, 74)",4.2,"375 mL bottle. Deep purple body. Smells pretty boozy, but it has a strong berry aroma behind it. Cherry and currants most prominent. Tastes much less boozy, but the alcohol is still prevalent. Sweet honey immediately cut by currant acidity. Cherry kinda adds back to the sweetness. Almost dries out in the back end with the currants, but has a lingering bit of honey sweetness. Long alcoholic finish. Sweet and a little syrupy. Superb fruit flavor, as always."
Schramm's A Smile of Fortune,"(1, 75)",4.6,Bottle. Pours deep purple/red. Nose is deep honey and fruit. Flavor showcases the fruits so well. Wow. Every fruit is present and complement each other amazingly. Ken does it again! Wow.

Schramm's A Smile of Fortune,"(1, 77)",4.8,"Complex and delicious. 4 different fruits blend nicely. Nose is powerful fruit with just a touch of alcohol warmth, similar fruits to Heart of Darkness but with boysenberries added. While lacking the handcrafted aspect, a great beverage in its own right."
Schramm's A Smile of Fortune,"(1, 78)",4.7,"Another knockout mead from Schramm’s. Stopped by for the release a couple weeks ago and tried this on tap. Absolutely amazing. 
Just coats your mouth in fruity sunshine. Loved the cherry notes the best."

Schramm's A Smile of Fortune,"(1, 80)",4.8,"Close to perfection. All of the elements come out in this one. Great, thick mouthfeel. Cherries up front. Raspberries in the middle. Boysenberries on the back end. And if you know what a black currant tastes like, you can taste it all the way through. After the swallow, lingering flavors coat the mouth, leaving your mouth watering for more. YASSS"
Schramm's A Smile of Fortune,"(1, 81)",4.6,Just a straight up fruit bomb per usual for Schramm’s. Almost opaque yet still has beautiful clarity. Nose is juicy fruit. Just superb.
Schramm's A Smile of Fortune,"(1, 82)",4.9,Schramm’s keeps on cranking out the hits!!! A perfect mix of fruit combined to make thos special mead. Definitely one of my favorites.
Schramm's A Smile of Fortune,"(1, 83)",4.7,"Tasted this in the tasting room a few weeks back, and while Cranberry will always be my favorite, this gets very close. The raspberry and cherry flavors blend perfectly, and harmonize elegantly with the aroma. Schramm’s has delivered another hit with ASOF and I will no doubt be seeking more of this soon."

Schramm's A Smile of Fortune,"(1, 85)",4.5,"Smell is heavy sweet cherry and plum and berry. Taste is like if you put a tiny splash each of Madeline, Black Agnes, and Raspberry into a small pour of The Statement. Basically the Statement taste in it is what is most prominent. Full body with a very slight alcohol taste and heat."
Schramm's A Smile of Fortune,"(1, 86)",4.1,"From bottle @ Schramm’s mead day 2016. Pour is deep red/purple, aroma and flavor of light raspberry juice, heavy boysenberry, semi-sweet cherries, and jammy black currants. Finish is mostly black currants and very sweet."
Schramm's A Smile of Fortune,"(1, 87)",4.5,"Leftovers from the Anniversary Party. Pour at the Meadery. The pour is a dark garnet with some great legs of alcohol on the glass with a staining ability. The aroma is full of berries. Cherry, currant, boysenberry, and raspberry are all present with just a sweet hint of honey. The flavor is much of the same. Heavy currant and cherry with a light raspberry and a tartness from the boysenberry. The mouth feel is thick and syrupy with a honey texture and a lingeringly sweet, yet tart berry. This is awesome."
Schramm's A Smile of Fortune,"(1, 88)",4.5,Sampled at Schramms where it pours up with a deep clear purple body that tosses up some nice legginess. The aroma pulses with inviting berry notes. I can easily smell this from two feet away. I get current jammy heaven with a bit of a bosenberry and waxy honey at the edges. The taste is straight up rich nectar AWESOME! It’s yummy jammy black currants and bosenberry and cherry. Wow jammy juicy and then mild fruity tartness towards the finish. I can sip on this for days . . .
Schramm's A Smile of Fortune,"(1, 89)",4.5,"Tap at Schramm’s. Aroma is huge black currant with some cherry and raspberry underneath. Tastes incredible like every Schramm’s mead. Don’t get much boys ever but the currant, cherry and raspberry blend so well together. Moderate to strong sweetness. Ultra smooth with the usual syrupy mouthfeel. Nice touch of alcohol in the finish. Up there with the best."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 1)",4.3,"Pours clear golden yellow with a lively soapy white head.

Tons of zesty tangerine, citrus, tropical sweetness, florals, subtle dank grass, and a mouth coating lingering soft bitterness.

To be a TIPA, it’s definitely the best I’ve tried. Very balanced considering the ABV.

This is just perfect 👏👏"
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 2)",4,"Draught at Monk's: pours gold with white head. Pine and loads of citrus: much grapefruit and the like. Slight boozy notes, but they meld well. Somewhat bitter, a bit sweet. Undeiably well crafted. Glad I got it in a bar rather than waiting in line."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 3)",4,"Draft. Pours gold with a white head. Dank and grassy hops, moderate bitterness, some pith and orange rind, and a dank and bright hoppy finish. Overhyped? Sure. But still pretty damn good."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 4)",3.7,"Pours hazy jonquil with a fair eggshell head. Aroma yields resiny hops, juicy tangerine, a tropical note. Flavor features bitter piney hops, zesty tangerine, mango. Texture wraps up with nice body & lively fizz. Another one of my beer bucket list!"
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 5)",3.4,"At Dror's place, pours clear with a small head, aroma of orange, marmalade, malt, flavor is bitter with orange, tangerine, medium bodied"
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 6)",2.5,"2023 bottle - Pours light yellowish orange with very little head  Wow...really never thought I'd get a chance to try this. Unfortunately this isn't my jam. Sharp, boozy, real light hoppiness that just gets lost in the sweet alcohol. Light, well carbonated."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 7)",4.3,"On tap at Isaac Newton’s in Newtown, PA. 10.2% ABV. Finally, at long last, I have landed this legendary brew! Bright, honey gold pour. Brief white head reduces to a small ring. Fragrant, bold citrus aroma is redolent of tangerine, lime, grapefruit and apricot. Big and boozy, as expected. Clean and crisp throughout. Black pepper notes on the backend. Slightly sticky palate in the long, bitter finish. Amazing!"
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 8)",4.9,On tap at Pete’s in Danville. Won annual lotto pick for 10oz pour. Excellent old school WC original. Like the Elder you don’t feel the high gravity(11%) until a little later which is fortunate because it’s easy to drink!
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 9)",4.2,"1 pint bottle, bottled 03/22/22, shared by Rob, many thanks! 
Golden, clear body, with a medium, creamy, lacing, white head.
Aroma of grapefruit, earth, passion fruit, biscuit, pine, resin, slight alcohol. Tastes pretty similar. 
Medium, creamy mouthfeel, with a quite lively carbonation. Finishes warm, medium bitter, moderate sweet, zesty, a bit piney, with some tropical fruits, biscuit.

Very tasty. Classic west coast TIPA, very well balanced, not too heavy or alcoholic for the ABV. The character isn't that different to the Elder, just a bit more sweet body. Score: 8 / 4 / 8 / 5 / 17"
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 10)",4.3,Thanks Greg for sharing this. Great to finally try it. Fresh. Piney hops. Medium sweet and resinous good.
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 11)",4.9,"Finally got to try this beer!  Clear medium yellow pour, nice piney sweet aroma and minimal carbonation.  Flavor is pleasant blend of sweet and slightly bitter hops and finishes with a great lingering mild bitterness and warmth."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 12)",4.2,"Got it on tap at Tustin Brewing Company (raced over when I saw they'd put it on tap).  My first impression is that this tastes a *lot* like Pliny the Elder with more bitterness in the finish.  It looks like that beer with a clear light amber body but almost no head at all.  The bitterness has some citrus rind but it's quite vegetal in nature although not overpowering like some IPAs.  It reminds me a bit of the hop flavor in Sierra Nevada's Hoptimum.   Good balancing sweetness and it's very drinkable at 10.25% ABV.  The hops really dig in all the way around the tongue and stay put long after the sip is over.  A great ""triple"" IPA that I would definitely make an effort to try again, but I wouldn't go through some of the ridiculous efforts that I've heard others have to go through to get it."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 13)",5,I have been lucky to have had this beer 5 years in a row now and this yeara batch is my favorite.   How a triple IPA taste this smooth and so not over bitter is a mystery.   The best thing this year found a local spot with no lines or limits!  Cheers 🍻 to 2022 Pliny The Younger!
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 14)",4.4,"Mostly clear gold with a soapy white head. Aroma is intense citrus, grapefruit m, pine and floral. Taste is light/medium sweet and heavy bitter."

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 18)",3.8,"Overrated.   Best in its day, but  eclipsed by other beers you can buy every day.   Sometimes,  enforced scarcity is not a good marketing ploy.

Overall
It is said that this was a QDH TIPA. There were signs which suggested that this beer was a hugely improved version of DDH PTE - sweetness, floral, corn, ripe fruits, refreshing bitterness, etc. The improvement is mainly about the mouthfeel - such thick and creamy, without any peppery pungency. This beer is extremely easy drinking and enjoyable, especially for sweet enthusiasts.  A redefinition of West Coast IPA!
据说这是款四倍干投的三倍IPA。有一些迹象表明这款酒是DDH PTE的魔改版——可以感受到甜度、花香、玉米味、成熟的果味还有清爽的苦度等一脉相承的特征。改进之处主要在于口感，如此的厚重而又细腻，没有丝毫的椒麻感。这款酒极其的易饮且愉悦，尤其是对于甜渣党而言。它重新定义了西海岸IPA！

Po raz pierwszy wypuszczone już w 2005 roku!
Piwo do zeszłego roku było dostępne tylko i wyłącznie lane w browarze w Santa Rosa, jeden jedyny dzień w roku, w lutym. Długie kolejki beer geeków wyczekiwały godzinami na możliwość spróbowania tego majstersztyku.
W zeszłym i w tym roku właściciele browaru, małżeństwo Natalie i Vinnie Cilurzo zdecydowali się zabutelkować Pliniusza. 
W 2021 roku do szerokiej palety chmieli dołączył nowy chmiel - Elixir. 

Pliniusz Młodszy nalewa się z białą, puszystą jak śnieg pianą, która powolutku osuwa się w dół zostawiając umiarkowanej ilości krążki.
Kolorek złoty, czysty, klarowny.
Już po zdjęciu brandowanej czapeczki czuć siłę i intensywność chmielu. Pachnie fenomenalnie - żywica, igiełki sosnowe, las, lawina cytrusów, z których najmocniej wyczuwalne są pomarańcze i mandarynki. Przyjemna słodowość, a zaraz za nią minimalne kwiatowe nutki. Po ogrzaniu w dłoniach jeszcze więcej żywicznych detali. 
Smak bucha intensywnością, a zarazem zaskakuje lekkością i gładkością doznań.
Intensywnie iglasty, leśny z elementami igiełek sosnowych. Potęga cytrusów: mandarynek, grejpfrutów, pomarańczy przypieczętowana elementami ananasa. Goryczka konkretna, ale w żadnym stopniu nie  przytłaczająca.
Arcymistrzowski balans. Ciało potężne i zbite. Raz goryczkowe, raz słodkie, raz cytrusowe, raz kwiatowe, raz żywiczne. Całość połączona w niezapomniany obrazek. 
Doskonałe, niezapomniane doświadczenie. 
Hype is real!😍🤩🔥💥🍻"

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 30)",4.4,"510ml bottle. Crisp, massively hoppy and bitter with some grass, tropical fruits, pine, resin, citrus, floral and herbal notes. Tasty stuff for a hophead. It's been a while since I've had a properly bitter beer like this. Nomnom"
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 31)",4.7,"Arguably the most sought-after IPA in the world, the almost mythical offspring of Russian River's legendary Pliny the Elder, created in 2005 as a superlative to the Elder in a sense - effectively creating 'triple IPA' as a genre, even if double IPA and triple IPA are obviously a continuum and both are regarded as one single category on this site.  Hopped with Amarillo, Chinook, Citra, Mosaic, Simcoe and more - a complete line-up of famed New World hop varieties, in other words.  Originally released as a winter seasonal and so far only made available from tap in the two tasting rooms of the brewery each year in February, but thank the beer gods that the Cilurzos decided to try and bottle it this year - enabling it to travel, with so far one single bottle having reached Belgium, a bottle I was very honoured to get a sample of.  If, among all those famous and top class American masterpieces, there was one I never thought I could ever taste, it's this one - so I cannot thank Bart enough for inviting me to the tasting of this celebrity.  Medium thick, snow white, mousy, opening head with a waferthin, disparate 'veil' of foam left in the middle; equally hazy bright yellow golden robe.  Vibrant, colourful, zesty and slightly dank aroma of drying orange peel, green olives, lime zest, gin, orange water, freshly cut green onions, unripe mango, raw pineapple, dough, peanut oil, yellow grapefruit.  Clean but bright and intense fruitiness hinting at unripe mango, green banana and hard pear, lively carbonated though nowhere harshly so; full, smooth-edged, oily body.  A rounded, clean white-bready maltiness is soaked in aromatic, yet well-contained hoppiness, pineapple-ish and (green-) oniony, but most of all very zesty (lime, pomelo), providing long lingering 'green and yellow' aromas as well as a long-stretched, but refined peppery bitterness, highlighted by a gin-like alcohol warmth - and topped with an ever so subtle sweaty note (frying shallot).  This is about as radiant, refined, wonderfully balanced and at the same time expressive and powerful IPA gets: a truly fantastic beer and a standard in IPA in general indeed, even if the hazy New England idiom has meanwhile taken over the larger part of it.  I feel humbled by this kind of perfection - for me, having initially developed a taste for West Coast boldness, this masterpiece is very much worth the hype, though I also have to add that I would probably not wait for eight hours in line for two bottles, like many people in California apparently did a few weeks ago when this was released.  That said, I have no idea how IPA can be made any more beguiling, beautiful, radiant, balanced and intelligent; I cannot immediately think of a better one I had and at this level of 'mythical status', scores seem rather petty - so heck, have a near perfect score as far as I'm concerned, you deserve it.  Considering how bottles are already sold on the second hand market for hundreds of dollars, the very reason why the brewery never wanted to bottle this beer in the first place, it remains doubtful if this 'experiment' of bottling Pliny the Younger will be repeated next year - so for the time being, I'll consider this a once in a lifetime opportunity, which obviously adds to the experience and, I admit it, to my personal appreciation."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 32)",4.6,On tap at Falling Rock Tap House in Denver! Incredibly smooth. But with intense flavor. It’s all about the palate here. The balance is bonkers. So light but so good.
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 33)",4.3,"2020 batch Tap at Tustin brewing. Pours light gold, little head. Honey, resin aroma. Taste is similar, very smooth, piney hops and caramel malt. Big finish of resiny hops. Dope. And the booze is not apparent. Classy triple ipa. 4.3

2023 batch Tap at Tustin Brewing. Pours very pale yella almost no head. Big earthy yeasty aroma. Natural amd yet something like what you get when you wak into an old world market: freshly picked root veggies, fruits and smoked meats. It's a west coast barley wine goddamnit! Soft, light body, subtle and explosive at the same time. The abv is insanely deceptive."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 34)",4.1,Hop aroma pine taste no after taste over all it's better then most  but missing something very good but extremely over hyped  there are many other IPA  that are as good or better.  But younger is very good
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 35)",4.4,Poured from the tap.  Slightly hazy golden with white head. OMG! Worth the search!
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 36)",4.4,"Pine, floral, caramel, and hoppy. Light golden with a slight amber. Taste is caramel, hoppy, malty, spice, sweet citrus, pine, light alcohol burn, medium bitterness. Very balanced. Easy to drink. Powerful beer. Worth getting once, too expensive otherwise."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 37)",5,Tremendous triple IPA.  Builds on all the flavors I enjoy with Pliny the Elder.
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 38)",4.2,Trully disappointed by the fact that this jug contained awesome beer instead of Russian River water.
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 39)",4.3,"Pours a mostly clear golden orange on tap with fluffy peaks of rocky white foam that dissipates slowly to leave good lacing on the way down. Aroma of resinous hops, pithy citrus and pine with touches of catty dankness and fruity undertones, and a nice sweet maltiness to remind you of it's abv. Taste follows, resinous and dank, hoppy as all get out without being overly bitter due to the malt backbone and the booze, all balanced to perfection. Is this an amazing beer? Hell yes. Is it one of the best IPAs in the world anymore? Maybe not, but still amazing, and the scarcity lends to its high ratings throughout."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 40)",5,Awesome beer!  Pretty smooth for a triple IPA!  Been hunting this one for three years here in Colorado. Was finally able to have it earlier this year!  Definitely will have to find again.
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 41)",4.3,"Hop forward, backward, upstairs, downstairs and aroundstairs.  Evergreen and citrus aroma moves into your nose and takes over.  Taste is spice and hop and is well balanced.  Long lasting hop finish. Looks fine too with white head."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 42)",4.3,"10 oz pour on tap at Blue Palms Brewhouse (unfortunately, it kicked later than night so no more--maybe next year!). Appearance is lightly hazy yellow with nice sparkle, thin cap of white head with fair retention and trace leggy lacing. Aroma is strong pine, grapefruit, citrus. Taste is strong grapefruit, pine, lighter tropical fruit and citrus. Palate is medium bodied with smooth, thick texture, soft carbonation and fairly dry, crisp finish as taste, dominated by a pleasant grapefruit/piney bitterness. Overall, very, very nice. Bold aroma and flavor but not quite as complex as Elder. It's no wonder these two have received the iconic status they have, given how long they have been around (Elder added '01, Younger '05). They still stand up and obviously paved the way for more flavorful, juicy IPA's but must have been truly revolutionary back in the day."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 43)",4.4,"Beautiful beer, foamy head giving off aromas of pine, citrus, honey.  Smooth, creamy, robust but impeccably balanced.  Really enjoyed it."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 44)",4.2,"It pours clear golden with a white head.  It has s fairly full body with semi sharp carbonation.  It has a load of pine, spice, funk and grassy hops.  There is lightly toasted malt there too, but super hop forward.  Glad I was able to luck into this being on tap at beer mongers while on vacation on Portland"
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 45)",4.7,"Thick, syrupy, thin, carbonated, paradox. Slightly hazy. Strong, piney, citrus, long finish. Pure intense carbonated hop juice, aftertaste like you chewed on a hop pellet."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 46)",4.6,"On tap at Apex in Portland, OR. What a beer! Slightly hazy golden pour with minimal head. Sticky, oily mouthfeel. Huge resin and pine aroma and taste, with lots of tropical fruit behind in the taste. Complex. Balanced. The fruit hints at a sweetness that never comes forward. Bitterness never overwhelms, either. Alcohol well hidden. A beer to be sipped and appreciated. Lovely."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 47)",4.7,"Mission accomplished!  I was finally able to have Pliny the Younger.  This is a piney, extreme tropical hoppiness bomb on the nose! Taste follows with a very smooth finish.  This felt more like a DIPA than a TIPA.  It has a subdued bitterness on the finish and hides the alcohol very well.  For my palate, I think I actually prefer Pliny the Elder to this one, though.  Still very, very good and worth the wait to try it!"
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 48)",4.7,"Maybe it's that I've sampled a few different TIPAs of varying quality over the past few weeks, maybe it's that I've been sitting in my basement in southeast Tennessee sipping Younger and feeling extra special, but goddamn if this beer isn't the platonic ideal of what a massive, gargantuan India Pale Ale should be. Enormous amounts of citrus on the nose, yet the fruit only forms part of the taste, instead allowing plenty of room for deep, herbaceous pine and hints of berry and resin, with a modest but sturdy malt backbone and clingy bitterness on the finish. Amazing. Balanced, full, and gentle despite the whopping ABV. So friggin' good."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 49)",3.9,"Draught at Mikkeller SF. Amber color, white head. Bitter taste with grapefruit, floral hops, resin, caramel, pine and a bit of mango. Bitter finish with grapefruit, floral hops, resin, pine, a bit of caramel and mango. Excellent imperial IPA, although not living up to the hype."

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 53)",3.8,"Handbottled sample shared during MBCC pizza break. Thank you Mykel! Hazy burnt orange pour with a small creamy offwhite head. Pine, grass, caramel and a hint of tropical fruits in the nose. Some alcohol and as expected from the way this was brought to us some oxidation. Sweet and heavy bitter taste. Solid round, astringent and tiny boozy mouthfeel. while not in the best shape it's obvious this is a very good beer fresh. Happy to have the tick but will still try to make the trip to try this fresh."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 54)",4.7,"Drank the 2018 version at the brewery. This triple IPA lives up to the hype. Incredibly smooth for a 10.25 abv beer, the alcohol is well hidden. Sweet citrus notes, hoppy, dank and floral. The beer smells as good as it tastes. Not much foam on the head. One of the best beers I ever tasted."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 55)",4,"Tap at O'Brien's. Pours clear gold. Aroma and flavor are booze, honey, floral notes, floral, dank, faint pine, and juicy citrus. Full body."

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 57)",4,"Draft at O'Brien's. Pours almost clear gold with a bubbly off white head. Tastes like caramel malt, grapefruit hops, a hint of pine, a hint of resin, a hint of honey, and some smooth booze. Light/medium body and carbonation. Smells like caramel malt, grapefruit and pine hops, resin, and smooth booze."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 58)",4.2,"Tap @Ben & Nicks Bar in Oakland. Heavy scent of sweet exotic fruits and sour passion fruit. Full-bodied taste that is creamy and sweet with a bitter aftertaste that unfortunately has some alcoholic taste to it.

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 59)",4,"On tap at Rose & Crown in Palo Alto, CA with John Barretto. Aroma is pineapple, dank weed. Extremely juicy and danky and back-to-back with The Elder makes the older one seem watery. Very concentrated. An earthy dank marmalade of an IPA."

Medelhårt kolsyrad sjukt balanserad tydlig beska. Bärig och citrusfrukter. Jäkligt balanserad inget sticker ut. Mycket bättre öl än Pliny the older. 22 min kl 11.52 alltså 5 min efter jag beställt så ropade bartendern ut ”cage empty” och alla applåderade . Så skulle alla bra Dipor säljas slut på 22 min👍👍.

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 63)",4.3,"Stood in line, being alone jumped me up a bit. Small, bright golden pour, small, scant head. Piney, hoppy aroma, flavor blossoms with resinous hoppy bitterness, ABV comes in late with a wallop. First sip was meh, but it gets better with each one. Scratch this off the bucket list."

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 65)",3.7,"Dark copper color with a thick head. Aroma is of fresh hops, pine, mango, apricot, and citrus. Has a carbonated palate. Flavor is of malts, booze, hops, citrus, and some bitterness. Leaves a hoppy finish. Still a little hot."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 66)",4.8,"There's not much more to be said about this beer that hasn't already been written! A wonderful IPA with a great gamut of hip flavors. Surprisingly, it's not too bitter, allowing you to focus on the rest of the flavor profile"
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 67)",4.2,"Draft at Monk’s in Philadelphia, 2017 tapping. Pours clear amber with just a touch of a white head. Deep, hoppy aroma, with notes of resin and pine. Full-bodied and somewhat oily. Long finish with an astringent dryness, but the alcohol was very well-controlled. Resin and pine hops flavors, perhaps a note of grapefruit peel too. A note of orange shows up front as it warms."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 68)",4.2,"On tap at Capones for the 2017 release. After having a bunch of fun in line drinking a coupe of beers, came in to a reserved table (thanks Matt) and sat down to enjoy the beer. Served fairly cold in a small snifter, side by side with Elder and Bling Pig which was pretty interesting. Younger was dryer and smoother than the other two, fairly strong resin but balanced with tangerine, melon and grapefruit along with a fairly strong malt presence. Bitterness is strong but doesn’t become astringent, boozy and yummy."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 69)",4.3,"On draft at Monk’s Cafe Philly. The seven different hops definitely come through, very well-rounded, abundant hoppiness. Not too bitter, fruity, crisp, citrus. Excellent."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 70)",4.5,This beer smells of pine with a beautiful golden orange color. It is very hop forward with a lot of pine and a bit of floral in the follow through. It feels heavier on the palate than most IPAs do. An outstanding beer.
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 71)",3.6,Draft pour to take out ;) pours out golden nose is sweet dank hops plenty caramel. Taste is more of the caramel malt sweetness and some dank hops.
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 72)",4.2,"On tap at the Side Street Cafe. Pours golden in color. Very thin white head. Scent is pine and hops. Taste is some sweetness, hops. Both linger for a bit. Very tasty!"

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 74)",4,"Slightly hazy golden colour. Aroma of intense bitter hops, lot of citrus, grapefruit. Taste of quite bitter grassy hops, tons of citrus, grapefruit, long bitter fruity finish, good!"
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 75)",4.1,"Thanks to the anonymous donor of the sample: I have waited quite a while for this and I really wasn’t sure if I would ever try a Pliny the Younger. Much as was my experience with Pliny the Elder, I understand now why this is such a defining beer for its style and even its region. Pliny the Younger is a very well executed West Coast Triple IPA, it has all the typical hop notes of a good West Coast IPA just condensed into a much more intense experience. It’s almost oily from all of the hops, brimming with notes of tropical fruit, grapefruit and pine needles. I hate to say that it’s not my favorite Triple IPA but it’s certainly up there with only a handful of others worldwide that I have had the opportunity to taste."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 76)",5,"Very long flavour, balanced malt&hops. Lingering bitterness. Great triple IPA."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 77)",4.2,"Sampled from tap. Clear golden color with white head. Aroma is intense hops, grapefruit, boozy. Taste is hop oils, grapefruit, grassy, quite some booze and residual sweetness. Bitter, slightly warming finish. Medium carbonation, oily mouthfeel, massive strong kick. Everything about this works - but Triple IPA is not exactly my style, which is why I don’t go completely crazy about this."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 78)",4.6,"Tap at SF Beer Week Opening Gala: Clear straw with little head and no lace. Huge lift of hops. Tropical citrus and stone notes. Loved the nose but it’s the palate which is incredible. Superb mouthfeel and depth of flavor. Rich with some unfermented sugar. The bitterness is there but not overwhelming. For such a massive beer the balance is awesome. 
Tasted the Elder directly after this and it looked like a commercial IPA. The most disappointing thing about this beer is that it’s impossible to find an environment that you can relax, analyze and enjoy the beer."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 79)",4.7,"Tap at SF Beer Week Opening Gala. Finally, the mother of the Whalezzz!

Pours lear golden amber. Little head.
Aroma is strong tropical fruit, pines, mango, light citrus, resin.
Residual sweetness into a heavy body, late bitterness, not sticky, good to drink.
Lingering sweet, yet still not sticky palate.
Great balance, superb experience. 
Had this as my first beer, and it tasted like the Elder. Then after this I directly had the Elder, which was a soft simple IPA compared with this bomb.
Worth the hype? Depends. I enjoyed the experience, but I don’t feel the need to take such an effort again."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 80)",4.5,"Pours hazy golden with low white head

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 81)",4.3,"Pours clear light orange with a low white head. Aromas of peach, pine, resin, apricot, grass. Taste is very fruity and quite bitter with grassy and light floral notes. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a very clean palate. Moderate carbonation."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 82)",4.2,"On tap at Russian River. 2/6/17. Pour is a clear honey golden color. Small white head, tons of lacing. Aromas are loaded with piney, earthy hops, hints of tropical fruit, citrus peel and a touch of alcohol. Taste is just loaded with hop wave after wave. Lemongrass, papaya, orange peel, sticky pine, touch of cereal sweetness with more doses of floral hops, tiny peat, hints of alcohol. Very balanced but definitely bitter and in the dry side. Very glad to taste this gem after all these years. A true classic."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 83)",4.1,"Growler at Peg’s Cycle BA Day, thanks to Sean who won the growler at a charity auction. Pours a clear gold with medium frothy white head that lasts.

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 84)",4.4,"Had it three times this year (2016). The first two times were disappointing, but the third time tasted much more fresh and clean. One of the best Imperials I’ve ever had."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 85)",4.2,"On tap at blue dog event. Had right after HF Susan and Legitimacy. I must say, I am very impressed. Yes, it’s overrated. Yes, it’s west coast. But yes, it’s awesome and worth the hype in some respects. This is the OG hop bomb. Pours a clear golden orange with a white head. Aromas of grapefruit, candies, orange, dank hops, alcohol. Taste is not crazy bitter, there is some hop flavors in there followed by some strange piney smokiness then there’s a tad of alcohol heat. I can see why this came to the top of our beloved RB list and has remained there simply out of respect. On to the next one..."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 86)",4.5,Had this on tap on Saturday. Was expecting much more from the hype this beer has but I was not at all dissapointed. This is pretty much an amped up Pliny the Elder. I had Elder right after and Elder tasted like water in comparison. Definitely the most balanced triple IPA I’ve ever had.
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 87)",4.4,"750th rating for this beer, my 8819th. Half pint on draft at the brewery. And then a second. And a third. And that’s all they allow. We waited all night in line for the first Friday this went on tap in 2016, and were the third table seated. Back corner on the right - Platinum Baller Status table. You’ll see us in any number of regional news sources, representing beer nerds from around the world who came just for this special beer or something like that. Pliny the Younger pours a somewhat cloudy orange-hued gold with a small eggshell colored head that laces the glass and settles into an island and ring. Notes of pine, grapefruit, caramel, florals, grass - the flavor has a more resinous, oily hop character and along with the ABV level, it just barely numbs the back of the tongue. Medium-full bodied, with a bitter, resinous, but balanced mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Excellent. Right on par with Pliny the Elder. World-class beers, both of them, and it was awesome to try them side-by-side. I’ve been waiting to try this for like 8 years and finally got the chance. It didn’t disappoint."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 88)",4.7,"Pours a slightly hazy gold with a thin white head and lacing. It has a super-rich hoppy aroma with pine, resin, and some floral notes. The flavor is resin and pine good up front with a bitter, long-lasting finish over a medium-heavy body.

Plenty of orange meat, some tangerine and a bit of sea grass. Accents of pine. Sweet malt. Flavor is moderately sweet with a strong bitter finish. Lemon pith. Orange peel. Nice and dry. Somewhat resinous. Very drinkable and surprisingly balanced. Warm finish. A touch oily. This is pretty stellar stuff indeed."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 93)",4.2,"Draft at the brewpub. Pours clear orange-gold with a slender, frothy white head. The nose has a lot of piney hops, pale bread, tangerine, light grass.

Warming finish, lightly resinous, with lots of juicy citrus fruits, tangerine, some grapefruit, nips of boosty alcohol, orange, mango, mellow bitter grass and citrus rind. Well, it’s very good, and very drinkable, but there are more expressive ’imperial’ IPAs out there nowadays. Still, I can appreciate that this is juicy and drinkable stuff."

Full bodied, fine carbonation with a slick resinous drift, semi aggressive hop bitterness in the close.
Well balanced and nuanced.... Top draw DIPA."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 95)",4.4,"Draught at Russian River. Clear deep golden liquid with medium off-white head. Aroma of tangerine, citrus, mango, pine, pineapple, light grain, light sweet malt and lychee. Taste is light sweet and medium bitter with notes of citrus, tangerine, light grain, pineapple and pine. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Very drinkable for the ABV. Great beer and worth waiting in line for. I have to say though, I prefer Elder as it is more drinkable and less malty. Still, a memory of a lifetime."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 96)",4.8,"Draft at source. After waiting in line for 11 hours i finally get it! Nose is huge with orange citrus and zest. Plain juicy in the aroma. Pours fairly clear with a small white head. Taste is initially quite bitter with citrus rind. Juicy citrus hop flavor follows at an amazingly intense orange and grapefruit. I didn’t think ""old"" American C hops could be this juicy and good. No sign of alcohol in the flavor but a light warming in the ears. Could just be sleep deprivation from camping in line over night. A truly great beer!"
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 97)",5,"Little variation?s each year, but for 2016 the super aroma is back! Less of the typical DIPA bite this year, so its real easy on the palate which I appreciate. The belch has great danky aroma in case you missed it the first time down.  Great balance. Perfection. Shines with a golden Aura that this beer really is magical!"
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 98)",4.6,"Pliny the younger is the de facto standard as the imperial / triple IPA. The aroma of strong grapefruit and pine with an almost ""orange"" appearance. Taste of bitter piney and grapefruit notes. Hits the palate rather cleanly for an IPA of this alcohol %. Doesn’t taste 11% and a beer to seek out an try during its 2 to 3 week release schedule in February. Cheers!"
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 99)",4.9,"On tap 2014 release, Redlands CA. Pours clear orange, small white head. Aroma of trop fruit, berries, sweet pale malts, crystal malts, fresh-squeezed citrus, citrus rind, slight dank, grass....OH MY GOD...I could go on all day. The complexity carries on into the taste. Mouthfeel is moderate syrupy with good carb. Cutting with high IBUs equals heavenly bliss. I only consumed 8oz, but damn it was good. If I had a 22bomber to drink, I wonder if my overall review of this rare white whale would change."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(1, 100)",5,On tap at beechwood a while back. Dark copper pour very carbonated to bring out awesome huge hoppy aromas of pine mango apricot and all other hoppy goodness. Lightly malted with some alcohol heat but hops prevail. Not super duper bitter just great use of hops. a+++
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 1)",4.3,"Originally reviewed on 3/14/15. A beer I thought I’d never get to try. 64 oz. growler poured into a snifter. Clear orange body with a small white head. A few wisps on the surface and a thin collar. Orange. Some pine hops. Lots of caramel malt, but doesn’t smell all that sugary. Tastes like an amped up Pliny. Orange hops up front. Sweet pale malts. A touch of booze. Pine hops build in the back end with a moderate bitterness.
Medium heavy. Not a sugar bomb, which I was afraid of. Medium carbonation. Glad I got to try it. It’s very good. I’d take a lot of things over it, especially if it avoids a trip to CA to get a taste."

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 10)",4.4,"Cross this one off the fermentation bucket list. Clear deep amber pour with a nice white head. Lots of lacing. Citrus pine tropical hoppy nose. Intense hops in the taste. The intensity works, without being overdone. Lots of bitterness in the finish with just a hint of alcohol. This is truly is a special hop experience. I could not have more than one of these, unlike Elder or Blind Pig. It’s a bad ass hoppy and bitter dry barleywine."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 11)",4.5,"Sample at DIPA Festival 2015, Hayward CA. Vibrant orange and super-bright, like it came with its own backlight. No head though - aroma seemed slightly subdued, but still hitting the tropical fruit juice points you would expect, some mango and a bit of dankness. Very oily, almost unique mouthfeel, both thick and dryingly thin at the same time. The obvious flavour is pineapple juice, with some tangerine thrown in, along with peach and some grapefruit in the finish. Finishes dry but right in balance with the hop bitterness. It’s super-hyped, it was the first keg to kick, but it was very good."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 12)",5,"Waited hours for this. Was it worth it NO. But was it one of best IPAs YES. Awesome pine, grass hop oil aroma ever. Fresh hop flavor lupine jump on palate all over place. Some alcohol and decidedly dry finish. Perfect!"

Very well crafted beer that is well balanced, while accentuating the hop flavor and aromas. The alcohol is well hidden and PtY is extremely drinkable. Had a PtE side by side and the Elder has never tasted so light."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 19)",4.7,"10oz pour at Obrien’s San Diego. 10min wait (score). Beautiful tangerine orange with only the slightest remnants of a thin white head. Slight oily sheen on top. Carbonation is low. Taste is very bright and fresh, piney resin coats the palate followed by moderately aggressive bitterness and then prominent floral notes and a bit of passion fruit. Was expecting more citrus and pineapple, but it didn’t really come though. Very dry, but hides the ABV extraordinarily well. Malt is far in the background, just my kind of triple IPA, dry, resinous, and very fresh. Glad I got my hands on this one."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 20)",4.1,"A very pleasant IPA to drink. Aroma of fresh hops, citrus and stone fruit. Some pine. Flavor is similar. The malt is a bit recessed but not weak. I thought the fruity flavors really come forth and there is a LONG bitter finish. That 10.2% is completely masked. Not very sticky or oily for a triple IPA. This is a bit hyped but it is also very good and up there with the best."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 21)",4,"On tap at Falling Rock. Great nose. Big aroma of citrus, pine, and earth. Very smooth, bitter and dry though the finish. Great pine taste, grass, spruce, and leather. It’s good, but not worth a three hour wait when there are so many others up to it’s standard."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 22)",5,Smooth piny aromas. Slightly hazy golden with white frothy head. So smooth with those signature hop flavors you expect from point but a even smoother delivery in a bigger beer. It lives up to the hype.
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 23)",4.5,"(En fût au Hamilton’s Tavern): Un liquide ambré dense et brumeux qui respire des sucres résineux, on dirait que les Sierra au complet ont servi d’houblonnage à cru. C’est plein de fruits tropicaux également et malgré tout c’est assez bien équilibré, dans le sommet du spectre évidemment. Vraiment surpris par celle-là, je croyais que l’anticipation allait l’étouffer."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 24)",4.9,"Got to brewpub on release day at 5:30 am. In the pouring rain waiting. Patiently. At 1:55pm Pliny the Younger was in front of me. 
Aroma was hoppy BO sweet beautiful.
Flavor. WORTH EVERY SOGGY MOMENT.. Juicy pine trees with the locker room kinda feel. Chose to taste Pliny the Elder for comparison. Subtle difference The difference in ABV was 3% & pulled off nicely. It takes a great brewer to create a outstanding base brew as Elder & improve to a higher ABV. Top 5 brews ever consumed."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 25)",4.5,"This beer is all about the experience. I remember the first time I had it at Toronado during San Francisco beer week. When the cask was cracked the whole bar smelled like hops. I'm tasting it now for the second time at Russian River. I was worried I may have had an overly hyped memory of how good it was. I needn't have worried. It's even more awesome than I remembered. It pours clear golden amber with an off-white head. Nose is huge citrus, grapefruit, pine resin, caramel, orange peel, lemon, and roasted malts. Flavour is a perfect balance of California hoppiness and sweet malts. It doesn't get any better."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 26)",4.3,"On tap at the Bistro DIPA festival. 
Aroma is nice with a lot of grapefruit, citrus, pine resin and tropical and stone fruit. Medium light malt notes with hints of caramel and honey. Some medium light alcohol spice. 
Pours a slightly cloudy golden orange with a moderately sized, thick, white head with good retention. 
Flavor is moderately sweet with a medium light malt character with hints of caramel that help hide the alcohol. High bitterness with a high hop character and medium light alcohol spice. The hops and malt help hide the alcohol well. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a really nice triple IPA. I forgot how good it is. The alcohol is well hidden and the beer isn’t too sweet. Lots of hop character."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 27)",4.2,"Sometimes it is more about the experience than the actual beer. I love this beer, though it is over-hyped. Great citrus/pine aroma, huge malty body with a balancing hop bitterness. All said and done this is really just a well executed hoppy barleywine."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 28)",3.9,"on draft. great aroma, medium flavor, perfect amount of head. overall a good beer but not as deep flavor profile as I was hoping. id love to have it again, though."

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 30)",4.7,"This is a very flavorful brew, big, very bitter, grapefruit-like citrus, but also quite fruity with an apparent sweet, orange citrus flavor. Aromatic grapefruit/hoppy nose is bigger, sweeter, fruitier and more balanced than the Elder. Thick, sticky, very sweet palate like a barleywine, but with a strong bitter bite to balance it out. Dark golden in color and a bit hazy in appearance."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 31)",4.2,"Tasted on 2/16/14 on draft at Russian River, and subsequently a couple of other times at Toronado. Pours beautiful bright orange with an average white head that slowly recedes to a thin collar, and very light spotty lace. The nose is full of super piney resin hops, some orange oil, and a very faint tropical fruit hint, and just enough caramel malt to balance the ridiculous amount of hops. The flavor is pretty much the same with the resin showing a bit dank, orange oil, nice malty caramel, and some peachy tropical fruit on the back of the palate. The body is full and sticky with just above average carbonation and a long resin bitter balanced by some fruity hops. The balance is what sets this beer apart from others in its style."

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 36)",5,"On draft at Varga Bar, Philadelphia, March 25, 2013. Dreadnaught33 and I made the trip up here, complete with tuxedos for the ""black tie"" event. Little did we know we’d be the only ones dressed for the occasion.

PtY pours a nearly clear golden orange color with active carbonation creating a ring of white head and ample lacing. Aroma is overall floral with a sweet fruity complexity, and slightly dank. Flavor is amazing: resinous, sweet and bitter all at the same time. Notes of tropical fruit, pine, malt and floral complexity combine to make this triple IPA worthy of the hype. For an 11% beer, the alcohol is very well masked. A memorable event to be able to try this."

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 40)",4.1,"At the brewery, Feb 14, 2014...after 5 hours in line 10am-3pm. As luck would have it I hadn’t kicked a cold and my Sudafed wasn’t quite strong enough. So I was getting maybe 25 of the nose. It was certainly potent enough to appreciate the aroma, perhaps a bit academically. It pours dark clear orange with no head or lace. The aroma is floral orange, honey, pine, very clean grain. The flavor is super clean intense bitterness all over, tip to back. The bitterness is drying and very long lasting. Notes of grapefruit, pine, wood, and subtle fruit sweetness weave in and out. The feel is dense. It doesn’t push or hide the alcohol. While I need to have it with my full capacity and may or may not give it higher marks overall it commands respect. It’s an archetype just like its smaller siblings."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 41)",4.8,"Appearance: dark golden. SRM about 8.5. White, creamy head with tiny and medium bubbles intermixed that disappears quickly. Lacing is good and lasting with tiny and small bubbles.

Aroma: citrus hop aroma with surprising maltiness. Floral and tart lemony. Slightly yeasty - raw bread dough.

Flavor: prominent and forward hop notes to start that balances well with maltiness. Brown sugar. Apricot. Finishes with bitter lime: zest and pith.

Mouth feel: lively prickle that lasts. Oily in texture- thick oil like olive. High viscosity.

Comments: very complex. Well- balanced overall. Balanced hop bitterness and maltiness at first that disappears and becomes malt-forward. Hops reintroduce themselves at the finish with a prominent bitter lime flavor. As the beer breathes and warms, maltiness increases. Notes of sweat begin to appear on the nose, as well."

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 45)",4.9,Genius beer. I had it at Russian river brewery on February 17 this year. For me it was as good as the hype. Amazing fruity aroma and mouth feel. Starts and ends perfectly and after three I was craving more. Several weeks later and back in Europe im still craving it. Delicious. Will go back next year for sure.

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 48)",4.7,"Great DIPA, much better than it’s older brother.

Lots of aroma and hop punch, but the kicker on this beer is how well balanced it is. Tastes less bitter than Elder with more hop kick. I feel like the true crime of this beer is it seems primed for back to back pint drinking, not unlike heady topper, but so few will ever get the chance."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 49)",4.1,"Pliny! That fever sets across the country. Hard to really say, I need to try this multiple times. Pours a clear dark copper color with a large white head. A super sweet malty nose, hop resin. The flavor is very smooth, really not a big bitter beer, caramel, green, massive fruity hops, toffee, sugary, pine, well any hop flavor imaginable is here. Very smooth and super drinkable. Awesome."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 50)",4.3,"Tap at West End. Pours clear, bright copper orange with quickly settling white head. Minimal lacing. Aroma is huge citrus and piney hops, resinous, floral. Flavor is big citrus, juicy, tangerine, spruce hops with a citrus, pine finish and lingering aftertaste. Crisp and clean. Moderate carbonation, medium body."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 51)",4.1,"Pretty good. Too much hype. 10+% tho. Very smooth. Not bitter at all. Medium finish. Just a mild hoppy nose. After a few sips, was definitely able to taste/smell the alcohol. Left me with a good buzz after only 2 8 oz. pours."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 52)",4,"On draft at La Trappe in San Francisco. $11 a pint and no line. GREAT!



A - Crimson gold with a 3 finger creamy head. Fades so slow with sticky lacing.



S - Nose is similar to elder. Smells like a pine cone with a lot of sweet esthers and nutty bits as well.



T - The taste is interesting. Clearly a west coast IPA. Sweet, borderline barleywine taste and a clear booziness that separates it from other imperial IPAs. A raw rind of lemon, grapefruit and clementines is there too. It’s a great beer for the abv. That’s pretty amazing about it.



M - Thick, malty and waves of hops.



O - I would actually say this is the closest to heady topper I’ve ever had with slightly more booze. In that regard, it’s like I’m drinking a heady topper in San Francisco minus the mineral water mouthfeel that heady has. Everything else is really similar"
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 53)",3.6,"Pliny the younger is an incredible beer. I waited in line for a few hours the other day just to try this beer for the first time. Many people who know me would consider me a hop head. With that said, I honestly think there are many beers out there that I have had, that are just as good as Pliny the younger. I wanted to see what all the hype was about, but I could have went down the street to a local brewery and got a beer just as good, for half the price, without standing in line all day. Don’t get me wrong, it is a great beer, but there are beers that should get the same amount of attention and appreciation."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 54)",3.8,"Poured from tap to glass. Soft orange hue with white head that dissipated quickly to a thin ring. Aroma is pine, mango, tangerine, melon, lemon, sugar. Mouthfeel is nice with medium body and moderate carbonation. Taste is sweet initially with a bitter following and slight ethanol in the finish. Overall this is a pretty nice Imperial IPA."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 55)",4.4,"On tap at Choice City Butcher. Appearance: finger of white head that lasts a minute or so, straw/golden yellow, clear. Aroma: light fruity sweetness, heavy fresh floral hops, lighter citrusy hops, slightest yeasty leather notes. Palate: light body, sticky texture, average carbonation, dry bitter lasting finish. I can still taste it. Taste: very brief but intense sweetness, right into extreme, but not over the top bitterness. Overall, there is a great reason for the rating of this beer, it is amazing. It is supremely hoppy, but not palate destroying, it does all of the little subtleties right."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 56)",4.2,"Tap. Pours orange with white head. Lots of hop aroma, grapefruit. Quite delicious, lots of great citrus going on, touch of malts...though not a bunch. Drank it next to the Elder and I have to say that it’s a toss up which one I’d prefer. Great beer and glad to have tried it."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 57)",4.3,"Pours a golden bronze color with a white head. Citrus, hop, pine, floral, caramel and malt aroma. Grapefruit, mango, orange, hop, pine, malt and some alcohol flavors. Medium body and carbonation. Well controlled bitterness and good malt balance. Citrus hop and moderately bitter finish. A fantastic beer but ridiculously overhyped which serves as a disappointment."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 58)",4.3,"Multiple pours at Falling Rock, Sunday release. Side by side with Pliny the Elder. Golden and clear with an average white head. Fresh, hoppy, fruity aroma with notes of citrus, pine, flowers, herbs and tropical fruit. Similar flavor, strong and bitter with minimal maltiness. Flavor hides the ABV well. Medium body with a lasting, bitter finish. About as good as IPA’s can get."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 59)",4.3,On tap at back country taproom. Pours a beautiful golden hue. Aroma is slightly hoppy with sweetness. Taste is sweet hops with more hops underneath. Despite that the beer is easy more sweet then hoppy. A great beer
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 60)",4.5,"On tap at Mohawk Bend, 6 oz pour which is actually plenty. Smells incredible, like hop soup. Few beers I’ve ever had communicate the hops this well. Taste is much like Elder but stronger (natch). A little alcohol burn at the back but well-concealed/integrated for the ABV.

Would I wait 3 hours for it? Probably not. We were able to pull it off with <30 minutes in line and since Mohawk handled the event superbly (serving in groups and tweeting out progress) it was no problem to show back up at the right time and grab ours. Glad we did, it was well worth the small amount of trouble.

Over-hyped maybe but not overrated. A delicious, well-made beer. See you next year!"

russian river has done an admirable job of creating a mystique surrounding this beer which im sure they love from a marketing perspective but i, for one, am tired of their ’gimmick’ of brewing tiny batches that last for only two weeks. from a marketing standpoint i get it but from a beer lovers perspective it’s annoying as hell.

if you cut through the cache there are better triples to be had.."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 63)",4.5,"On tap at the Brewpub. (Monday 10, February 2014)

Golden with a small white head. The aroma was fantastic, fresh with a lot of citrus, pineapple and hops. The taste was also very good although not as brilliant as the aroma. Very balanced with no alcohol at all, the Younger felt like juice. The finish was bitter and hoppy. 

We waited in the line for almost 6,5 hours, quite insane to be honest but what can you do? For sure an interesting experience, but I won’t do it again. A hyped beer but also a very tasty one."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 64)",4.8,Pours a clear light orange with a decent head. Aroma is citrucy tropical fruits and piney hops and Sweet malt. Taste follows the Aroma well with a nice Sweet malt backbone that is like fluffy. Very nice well balanced triple. After warming up a bit it started getting a danky hop character that was fantastic. Really nice quality supurb hops and malt and the alcohol is hidden very well only detectable with a warming feeling as you drink it. It Goes down easy and you feel buzzed quick. No doubt one of the Best ive had so far. Better Than pliny elder forsure and enjoy by. So smooth!
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 65)",4.5,"10 oz pour at the brewery. Clear golden pour with a white head. Aroma is catty, grapefruit. Taste is sweet with relatively restrained bitterness.

Expertly crafted and delicious, nonetheless."

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 67)",4.4,"Draft at the brewery. After 7 hrs in line. Finally. Pours a clear light amber orange color with a thin white head. Aroma is packed full of citrusy, fleshy, tropical fruit goodness. Flavor is right on par with the aroma. Tons of fruity sweetness with a moderate bitter. Tropical fruit notes last long into the finish with a mild bitter on the back of the tongue. Excellent beer. Obviously. Similar to the elder with a bit more of a punch."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 68)",4.7,"On tap from the brewery:
Not as much aroma as I’d expect from a fresh and massively dry-hopped triple IPA. Looks light in color for such a big IPA, just the way I like it. The flavor makes up for it with intense amarillo and simcoe notes. The alcohol is completely hidden, almost like a session IPA (which, I quickly found, it was not). Overall it’s objectively the best beer I’ve had and was definitely worth the wait."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 69)",3.9,"17 feb 2014, tap. Yellow, clear, steady bubbles. Nose is big lemon hops. Med body and mildly fizzy. I thought it was going to be more intense.

Good piney west coast that lingers very similar to double crooked tree but more balnce and pop at the same time. I thought being a Hopslam lover that it would be close. Had one within an hour of my first Younger, NOPE! Younger is the first or second best IPA i’ver ever had really really good stuff.

Dry lingering that finishes slow and ends in the nose. amazing beer."

T: Lot’s of hops and citrus notes in the beginning. Very piney half-way through and just the right amount of maltiness in the end.

M: Medium heaviness on the tongue, which switches to heavy after a few seconds. Can taste the hops for a long while after with a little maltiness to it.

Big resinous grapefruit rind aroma, along with floral perfume notes with some light malt and a bit of caramel. Sweet floral tastes, with lots of sweet malt and toffee undertones that help balance the impending hop onslaught.

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 84)",4.9,"Tap: Deep golden amber beer with a thick sticky white head. Aroma is freaking awesome. A huge blast of fresh grapefruit hop oils and bright pine resin. Tropical fruit, hoppy spice and a lot of alternation between fruity citrus and brash pine. Sticky hop oils on the palate that just fill your mouth with sweet hoppy goodness.

Great beer, but not my own personal number one--certainly not the best on the planet."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 90)",4.6,"Draft at Monks (now 3 years running, and the line keeps getting longer.) Usually the place is too crowded for the event to even attempt a live rating. So pulling a bit from memory here. I think what makes the Younger extraordinary is that it is both amazingly high hopped and very high in alcohol yet the finished product is so smooth and delicious that it feels impossibly drinkable. Simply like a very exact and refined sweet gentle IPA. Yet wait 10 minutes and the alcohol kicks in. Like a magic trick. On top of that it has a perfect looking gold pour. Clearly a lot of time and work went into making this beer appear effortless."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 91)",4.7,"Wow. So really, where do I begin??? I was in line on February first for about 5 and a half hours. Met some absolutely amazing people in line. First on that list would be Corey Reich and his mom Wendy - Amazing people. Both had the opportunity to skip the (very long) PtY line, and go in the back door. They refused to do so, and hung out with me and my friend Barry for quite some time. Eventually, the hot sun and very, very long line wore on them, and they went in a bit earlier than Barry and I. Fast forward a couple of hours - Barry and I got in - Wendy and Corey got us seated with them - and with Vinnie and Nat. Dear sweet Lord what an amazing day. One of the greatest experiences of my life. The beer was incredible too - If PtE is a bigger version of Blind Pig, then PtY is a bigger version of Happy Hops - and I REALLY love Happy Hops. In Brief: Big Passionfruit, white peach, nectarine, guava, and white tea - no bitterness, limited pine notes. The flavour was more of the same, but with unicorns and rainbows. Not really, but if you read my rating of Happy Hops, you’ll understand. This was delicate, fruity, fascinating, complex, and lovely. For the first time in a long time, a beer actually was worth the hype! Vinnie, Natalie, Corey, and Wendy are among my favorite people on earth! It was an amazing PtY day! and was shared with amazing people. And  oh yes, the beer lived up to the hype and then some. Special."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 92)",4.7,"On tap at Caponeâ€™s and Blue Dog in southeast PA. Looks like I accidentally overwrote my Younger rating with my Elder. It mostly lives up to the hype, although I wouldnâ€™t consider it the second best beer in the world. Side by side with Heady Topper, it doesnâ€™t even come close."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 93)",4.6,"Aroma is smack full of pine, grapefruit and other citrus. 

Appearance is amazing for a triple IPA. Crystal clear and golden amber in color

Taste. Grapefruit is intense. Pine and resin follow with a slightest hint if malt

Palate. It is a palate wrecker, but not as bad as you'd think. Fruit and citrus up front with a dry bitter finish. 

Overall, damn fine beer. Best in the world? That's subjective. Having tried it I wouldn't go out of my way to have it again. But if it was on tap....

Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 95)",4.5,On tap at Monk’s. Waited 2 hours in line for a 6oz pour and I would do it again. Crystal clear golden with lively carbonation. Smells of grapefruit pine and other tropical fruits. Intense hops up front that remains incredibly smooth and balanced.
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 96)",4.7,"After such a long quest for some PtY, I was finally able to imbibe on some of this goodness at the Bishop’s Collar in Philadelphia a couple weeks ago. Poured into a 4oz sampler glass (had two thanks to my wife who doesn’t drink beer) - Poured beautiful clear golden with an one-finger super white head with beautiful lacing that lasted very well throughout. The intense aroma was full of citrus and floral hops along with pine. PtY had the perfect blend of hops in the nose that work very well with each other. The taste sweeter and maltier than I expected, possibly to better balance out the loads of hops this beer has. This was by far better than Pliny the Elder - by a mile. Full of grapefruit and sweet like honey. The finish has a nice citrus and resiny note on the end as well. Mouthfeel had a perfect balance with lively carbonation lasting throughout the (obviously very short) drinking session. It really brought out the smoothness and balance between the malts and hops on the tongue without the bringing out the bitterness like I thought it would have due to the Blind Pig and Pliny the Elder, so this was a pleasant surprise! This beer was perfectly balanced all-around. It is truly such a shame that this beer is ""very expensive and difficult to make under tight space limits"" according to Russian River because this would have been the go-to IPA in many beer circles. Would love to try this again in the near future!"
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 97)",4.4,This is an excellent IPA. On tap from coastal Oregon (Twist). Rich clear orange color with sticky frothy white head. Moderate carbonation. Flavor is of somewhat piney and citrusy hops with elements of orange. Bitterness well controlled and balanced. Smell is of sweet corn cereal with hops. 9.8 BD
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 98)",4.7,"Pliny the Younger is a definite favorite. I first tried it years ago from a growler my brother brought back from the brewery (when they still did that), and I went for the release this year. Longer lines each year, but it’s great stuff."
Russian River Pliny the Younger,"(2, 99)",4.3,"On tap at Monk’s Monday Madness. Dark gold and orange pour with a sizable off-white head, leaving sticky blebs of lacing. Aroma is strong grapefruit, citrus, and pine. Also very sweet, biscuity, doughy, and sugary pine. Mmm. Flavor is huge citrus, grapefruit, and pine, with lovely malt sweetness to balance. Really easy-drinking; smooth, low carbonation, thick, creamy. A top-notch beer, certainly worth the wait. Glad to have had the opportunity to have this and meet some great people in the process.

Overall
The beer came as a complete surprise to me. It's more of an old bourbon-barrel aged Imperial Stout, or even Barleywine and Shaoxingwine, instead of a young Pastry Stout... With almost insanely salty, soy sauce-y and plumy, it reminds me of Goose Island Proprietor's Bourbon County Brand Stout 2014. No trace of common vanilla adjuncts (but it seems that vanilla beans can also have prune-like smell?), neither do marshmallow. Exactly match my palate, however I was expecting something totally different from this bottle. Hard to rate such...
这款酒完全出乎我的意料。它很像一款老年份的过桶帝国世涛，甚至大麦或者绍兴酒，就是不像年轻的甜世涛。。。如此疯狂的咸度、酱油味和话梅味，让我想起鹅岛的Proprietor's BCBS 2014。没有别的酒里常见的那种香草增味（但据说香草荚本身是带有西梅干味的？），也没有棉花糖。别说还真的特别合我的胃口，但问题是我开瓶之前期待的是完全不同的东西啊。给这种酒打分真是头疼。。。

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"(1, 31)",4.6,"Massing thanks to Compton25! Obtained in a trade. This one has been an absolute top want of mine since I got into beer, I managed (or thanks to the kindness of others I manged) to try almost every dream beer since then. This one kept eluding & I am the only one since basically almost everyone but seem to have tried this one. I have had several version of Dark Lord since then including the bourbon one in 2013 (perfection) & in 2015 or so, disappointment (too soy sauce / messy). I realize that people hate on these beers, I adored many BA version, I actually thought that the regular one was fair way back in 2012 but apparently it has been going downhill ever since or that is just perception. Anyway sparkling green wax, waxing is so old school now, modern Dark Lord special label. Pours black, head is amazing very deep, deepest coffee but sadly doesn’t last. No head very quickly. Nose is old school RIS syrup, pure molasses, treacle, syrup, so sweet thick syrupy with bourbon, candlewax vanilla mixed in, maple, insanely sweet molasses RIS syrup. Taste is chocolate desert pudding molasses, felts crazy strong pure sugar, maple, treacle, dark honey, bourbon concentrate syrup sugar, candy, butterscotch, unbelievably thick, syrupy & sweet,… Vanilla is not as big as hoped. Pure syrup, soft carbonation. Once you get into some ultra-sweet coffee in the back, melted chocolate. Pure insane sweet syrup, this kids is how rare special BA stouts used to taste like, even sweeter. Crazy sweet but tasty brew, pure candy syrup and sugar. Worked great with Thai food, it could bear the spices, strong flavours etc. Fight fire with fire."

As smooth as smooth gets, and the vanilla is just out of this world. Almost like my Créme Brûlée only liquefied and added tons of strong sweet chocolate. What a lovely flavor.

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"(1, 44)",4.3,"From notes. Enjoyed this during the 2nd Annual Kelly’s Island Bottle Share on September 18. 750 mL bottle. 2016 vintage. Holy hell, I never thought I’d get to try one of these! The pour is a jet black motor oil with a thin ring of brown head that dissipates. This looks like a tar pit. The aroma is heavy on the dark chocolate, sweet molasses, light bourbon, and bitter roast. The vanilla isn’t’ as heavy as I would’ve liked it on the nose. The alcohol is a little heavy on the finish. The flavor has a little more vanilla in it, but some of the other flavors intensify as well. The chocolate and molasses really explode. The bourbon takes on a thing of its own. The barrel even offers a little more. It’s complex, good, complete, but the vanilla isn’t as prominent as it should be. The mouth feel is thick and chewy with a soft carbonation and a bright vanilla on the aftertaste. The chocolate, bourbon, and maltiness are there, but the vanilla really comes through here. It’s by far the best Dark Lord anything I’ve had to date. This is a beautiful beer."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"(1, 45)",4.5,"Shared bottle. Not much in a way of appearance - dark brown thick liquid with virtually no foam, something you would expect from such a big beer. Rich and complex aroma dominated by vanilla and bourbon over the black chocolate and coffee notes common to imperial stouts in general. Tastes as complex as it smells, with vanilla, bourbon, wood, chocolate, caramel and coffee nuances playing in tandem and changing one another with every moment passing since the first sip. A truly magnificent dessert beer that provokes deep introspection and will make you think about the meaning of life while trying to get to the end of the aftertaste."

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"(1, 53)",4.8,"DLD taster... Thank you kind stranger... 2014 vintage. A dark elixir, unbelievable aroma. So smooth subtle and delicious... Lives up to the hype... A holy grail of RIS beers. Fantastic!!!

---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"(1, 54)",4.5,"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a nice large dark brown foamy head. Aroma of rich black chocolates notes with some vanilla and bourbon notes. Taste is a fantastic mix of rich black chocolate notes with some vanilla notes, some residuals sugar notes and some nice bourbon notes that smooth out any rough edges from this beer. Body is full with nice creamy texture and good carbonation and alcohol is not overly apparent. Fantastic complex mix while still keeping an excellent level of drinkability. 

Re-rate 2018: Still as enjoyable and the original pastry stout. This one tastes like smores."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"(1, 55)",4.8,"2014 vintage. Extremely sweet, and this sweetness gets somewhat unpleasant after drinking too much. By too much I mean about 15oz. The flavor is completely out of balance. This lack of balance is usually a huge minus, but in this case, not necessarily. Loads of vanilla, bourbon, molasses, coffee, marshmallow, brown sugar, chocolate, and syrup in a bottle! Holy hell. Flavor is not overly complex, mouthfeel is thick, and the marshmallow flavor lingers on for a long long time. The flavor develops as the beer warms up. Guys, let this beer chill for at least a couple hours. I don’t know if this beer is ""the best stout ever"" but it surely is unique and worth trying."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"(1, 56)",4.6,"Holy crap I wasn’t expecting this. Lucky enough to get this on tap at DLD 2016. Right place right time. Pours a deep dark black brown. No head. Aromas of big vanilla, vanilla, vanilla. Light coffee and coconut and fudge. Light booziness in the aroma. Taste is super sweet but it totally works. Long time want. Glad to have this one. Wooo."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"(1, 57)",4.5,"On Tap at RateBeer Best in Santa Rosa. Believe the hype. This was a straight up marshmallow bomb. Tons of vanilla, super thick mouthfeel, light bourbon and barrel. The vanilla takes the forefront. Super rich and delicious. Psyched to finally try this hard to come by beer."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"(1, 58)",4.3,"Bourbon Vanilla Dark Lord ’15 vintage 

Pours a brown-black color with a dark brown, small head to it, leaving back sheets of thin lacing atop the surface of the beer. Reveals its decadent viscosity after swirling, by revealing alcohol legs and tiny, dark brown bubbles at the glass.

Intense aromas of fudge, bakers chocolate and burned malts, tied together by a ridiculously rich Bourbon appearance, featuring flowery vanilla, a whiff of cinnamon, apple piths and a ton of scentened oak. Vanilla is easily detectable, while well entangled into the Bourbon, adding a organic, sweet, flowery freshness to the chocolate decadence. Mousse au chocolate, moldy earth, toffee and brownie batter round out this monster on the nose, so far truly a masterpiece, which I actually find hard to compare to the regular Dark Lord.

Has a supersmooth mouthfeel, due to its very low carbonation, next to a silk, omnipresent creaminess, coating the tongue and soothing the pleasantly integrated Bourbon effectivly.

Tastes of a spice soaked, earth coated oakiness, featuring the beers velvet mouthfeel from the start. Develops an enjoyable warmth, as the Bourbon unfolds its spice profile, together with vanilla, licorice, molasses and fudge. Vanilla certainly deserves an additional mentioning as it not only stands out from the Bourbon, but directly blends into the beers smooth cream quality, producing a heavenly, well accentuated sweetness, from which the profound spices benefit big times during the finish. Ends with cinnamon, red apple, fudge, molasses and a long lasting, silk, vanilla coke quality, smoothing out the Bourbon oak entirely.

Wow, what a behemoth of a beer. I guess it would be almost impossible to drink more of a few couple of oz of this, if it wasn’t for the soothing combination of cream and vanilla. This doesn’t turn overly roasty, but fudgy smooth with a ton of sweet chocolate to it, amped up by the spicy Bourbon. The different flavors come beautifully together, while this is still being best enjoyed in small sips, as for its profound sweetness."

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"(1, 61)",4.1,"On tap at RateBeer Best. It pours dark brown with a brown head. The aroma is full with chocolate syrup and vanilla ice cream. Massively sweet to the point of being sugary. The flavor is the same with a good dose of chocolate and vanilla. The alcohol notes are strong, but it serves this kind of beer well by cutting the huge sweetness. Very thick bodied and somewhat port-like. It goes down warming and satisfying. One of the sweeter beers at this festival, but it was ultimately very fun stuff to drink. Hardly any roasted malt or bitterness."

Pours is inky black with a very small dark brown head and minimal lacing. Aroma is over the top marshmallow, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate. Its like a desert topping.

The aroma has a ton of vanilla plus some chocolate and roasted malt. The flavor is very similar. The vanilla is right up front with some big barrel character coming through. I get some good whiskey that goes well with the chocolate and heavily roasted malt. The oak and maple go very well with the other notes and make this an outstanding beer. Thick mouthfeel and no discernible carbonation."
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"(1, 77)",4.6,Holy hell. Bourbon vanilla sweetness for days! Incredible mouthfeel. Thanks Sean for sharing.
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"(1, 78)",4.7,"More than worthy of the hype. There is literally nothing I can think of to change that would improve this beer. It even maintains a half-inch thick mocha head. 

There’s a depth of flavor and complexity that’s richer than any other barrel aged beer I’ve had... including BCBS Vanilla, Rare, Parabola, BA Vietnamese Speedway, etc... This is just more enjoyable. At 15% you taste no alcohol and only get a slight, but pleasing warming sensation as it goes down, with massive marshmallow, chocolate and vanilla-oak goodness forever lingering. 

I can’t do it justice by attempting to analyze and explain. It really is the Dark Lord of barrel aged beers. I need more"
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"(1, 79)",4.1,"Originally reviewed 3/9/2013. On tap at Hunahpu Day. Served in a taster.
 Jet black. No head. Small island of foam.

Smells ofvVanilla and bourbon. Bit surprise. Lots of sweet malts. Some traditional Dark Lord soy sauce.

Tastes of chocolate, vanilla, bourbon. No real barrel character beyond the bourbon flavor. Lots of bourbon and vanilla though. Lots of fudgy chocolate. Big soy sauce flavor and booze hinder it.
 Boozy but very tasty. Low in carbonation and huge in body.

It’s over the top, but the bourbon and vanilla mask what I don’t like about Dark Lord. It’s delicious only because of adjuncts."

Right out of the gate, dominant vanilla on the nose. That’s not a bad thing, obviously. Now, it moves to more obvious notes of caramel, cake, booze, but I get only feint barrel treatment here. Either way - quite nice. Now - what I noticed immediately is that the mouth feel was tapered off from my memory of recent dark lord vintages. That’s not a bad thing either - I’m impressed beyond words on how this one developed in the barrel(s), whatever it is they utilize. Sticky cake, caramel, umami, to brown sugars, moving to heavy vanilla notes once again - I get feint bourbon treatment at best - In fact it’s hardly noticeable and I suppose that’s one element of disappointment.

Beer is slightly syrupy but also has a pleasant thinness to it. Nice and oily. Flavor is very sweet. Bourbon barrel is supremely integrated and even throughout. Vanilla is more subtle than expected and only contributes on the back end. You really only notice it if you look for it, but when you find it, it's quite nice.

Smells like you soaked an old oak barrel stave in bourbon, rolled it in brown sugar, stuck a ton of marshmallows all along it, toasted it well over a fire, dipped it in chocolate, then topped everything off with a powerful vanilla drizzle. Aaaaand the taste is the same. Seriously. Huge notes of marshmallow fluff, Crème brûlée, rich vanilla beans, super-sweet baker’s chocolate, modestly creamy coffee, semi-burnt brown sugar, light molasses, well integrated woodiness from start to finish & a strong back-bone of booziness that you’d never guess was 14% ABV. A touch of dark fruit. Sweet... VERY sweet. But in the best kind of way. It’s delicious, really. Finishes with lingering notes of brown sugar, vanilla beans, wood, & Mallow Cups.

The nose on this is outstanding and redolent of coconut, coffee, roasted marshmallow, and in there somewhere is a salty/meaty umami scent that somehow mixes nicely with the sweeter smells. 

Appearance: pours like soy sauce; quickly dissipating leather colored head. Very stick on the side of the glass with good lacing. Better carbonation than regular dark lord, somehow.

Taste: OMG, is this BCBS Coffee? Could’ve fooled me. Honestly, very similar: here we have sweet chocolate, bitter coffee, and, every now and then, puffs of sweet marshmallow. A little sweeter than BCBS Coffee. Ends with a smooth vanilla flavor.

Palate: for as thick and sticky as it is, it cleans up pretty nicely in the mouth and feels rather light. Average to lively carbonation with a smooth finish."

Big notes of vanilla bean, roasted chestnut, coffee, chocolate, dark fruit...almost port wine-like notes as it warmed....marshmallow...and some sweet bourbon in the finish along with some more vanilla.

Split with my friend Keith who attended DLD with me this year. Served in a FFF mini-snifter. Reviewed from notes. 

A- Upon pouring, a mocha head quickly appears and dies down within 30 seconds, leaving a ring of foam around the rim of the glass. The color is opaque black, thick like motor oil. 

S- The first thing I can smell is a very strong bourbon barrel presence, but it is quickly joined by vanilla, coffee, and a sweet molasses like aroma. Excellent aroma, it definitely invites you to take a drink.

T- I don’t think it would be possible to use any more descriptors for this beer. Black cherries, prunes, vanilla, followed by some tobacco and caramel with bourbon strong on the finish. There is a lingering sweetness that is very familiar from regular dark lord on the back end, and surprisingly little to no alcohol bite, even with the bourbon flavor being so apparent. There is no detectable hop bitterness. 

M- Silky smooth, yet very thick at the same time. This is definitely a sipper, but it is very easy to drink. Low-medium carbonation is right on for the style. The flavors linger and change over the incredibly long finish, definitely over a minute later I can still taste the beer. 

O- This is a very enjoyable, incredibly complex beer. I’m glad I hadn’t drank anything before this, because it was such a pleasure to really get into this beer and enjoy the full range of flavors you can get from it. The bourbon is there on the nose and finish, but the vanilla really outshines it, at least in my opinion. I’m sure that will die down with time, although I think this is simply amazing as it is right now. It was an honor to drink this beer, so very glad I was able to score one this year!"

Appearance : Dark black with very small head.


Aroma : Rich spicy woody vanilla. Big vanilla taste. This screams bourbon BA. Syrupy. Light chocolate.


Taste : Roasted malt with big vanilla bourbon. Finish is a bit sweet with light alcohol. Lots of bourbon notes and vanilla. Light nutty notes.


Overall : Big and bold. A bit less sweetness that the regular version I think. Very heavy on the bourbon (probably accentuated by the vanilla beans). A bit too much bourbon for my taste. Quite tasty and all but lacks a bit of balance in my opinion. Still a great beer and I would certainly not say no to another sip of this."

What does Joe go and do, yes he pulls a Rare out of his cellar and we do a blind impromptu tasting!!! I admit on this day the Vanilla DL was better than the Rare (I was able to choose each correctly), but the Rare did not taste quite as good as when I had it initially. I can’t thank Joe enough for his generosity on this night. I guess I will put some actual beer comments in now. Of course this was a black pour with tan head. The aroma and taste were magical blends of chocolate, vanilla and bourbon. Each one in perfect harmony that created an other worldly experience. 2012 vintage, bottle 408 of 934."

Huge nose. Loads of candy corn butterscotch licorice vanilla and espresso.

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean,"(2, 97)",4.1,"Tap @ CBC 2013. Black, thick pour with a small tan head. Menacing appearance. The nose is toasted shredded coconut. Sweet marshmallow smore. Plenty of sugar, dark chocolate. Burnt caramel. The taste is very sweet. Vanilla-accented marshmallow smores. This and the brandy variant would definitely appeal to marshmallow enthusiasts. Milk chocolate, a bit of charred grain. Hot woody bourbon on the finish. Very oily and viscous. Thick. A real sipper indeed. Overall, quite good, though certainly not my favorite of the variants. Still, this was great to try without having to trade an arm and a leg for it."

Definitely some bias attached to having this bottle...long-time want that I never thought I would get to try, and considering the model served us with his wife telling us some stories from the wedding and how things happened while eating her lunch beside us on her break...well needless to say hard to find a better setting. That being said given the prices per glass and how old the beer was, we were all excited but realized it might be a disappointment. But opened up with quite the pop, clear golden pour with a frothy white head. Still seems quite bright and fresh with an amazing barnyard funk, grass, hay, lemon, epson salt and nice mineral character, musty, delicate and a moderate+ carbonation and full body, long complex finish with more funk and barnyard, dry and somewhat fruity, keeps on going. Also loved chugging the dregs...what an experience and overall one of the best beers I have ever had, albiet knowing the bias I went in with."

Dry hay, gueuze-y funk; sourness is there but not too bold. If you don't know what people mean by horse blanket in gueuze, you certainly will after this. Layers of depth and intrigue; gueuze really doesn't get much better than this.

3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(1, 41)",5,"2003 J and J version (not 50/50) drunk Summer of 2009 at my Farewell to the beer scene tasting
Inserted this one in the middle of the lineup, thankfully, so the palate was not fatigued. At almost six years old, it still poured a wonderfully frothy, white head, showing moderate retention and plentiful carbonation. Soft, straw/white-gold body, plenty of sediment on the bottom.
The nose creeps up on you, this is certainly not getting you by means of raw force/strength. The best part, and i will admit to being slightly hazy on all of the details, being that this was four years ago, was a soft, but yet tart hickory skin/limeade-like note that seemed to hover in the background and keep gaining strength as the beer warmed/breathed. Very dry and with tons of lactic acid but yet all well-presented. Some barnyard notes emerging late but just the most succulent, soft, yet strong brett notes I’ve witnessed.
In the mouth, the carbonation is fairly reserved for the style, with a warm woodiness that plays well with the tart, limey brett notes. Not overly sour, though significantly moreso than the Milennium gueuze I had a few months ago. Very ""true"" flavors of gueuze, lactic, brett fruity tartness, light band-aids; all that I associate with Girardin, though not as intensely sour as that usually seems. Interesting mineral-like note to it as well.  Finish leaves lactic acids lingering, with a bit of cheesiness and more unripened citrus fruits. Carbonation is soft by now, and the body is medium, with a supple texture from the malts and wheat. Wonder if I’ll ever try this again! Thanks to whomever traded me these (can’t remember at this point).
Bottle drunk 6/10/16, shared by Joe Z. Thanks!
Wow was this in just immaculate shape.  Even handily beat the Roze we opened just before it.  Limestone, white grape, soft oak, hickory nut skin, light band aids, very light sulfur....most of the stuff I look for in the top lambics.  Carbonation still VERY strong.  Texture is perfect.  Really can’t ask for much more from a gueuze.  Previously had it at 4.6."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(1, 42)",4.2,"Acquired in a trade from Mads in Denmark in February of 2013. Allowed this beer to sit horizontal in my basement for 10 months and now I’m ready to open it up on a random Saturday night by myself before a trip. Nothing fancy, just because. Also, temp of this thing is 55 at serving in a Cantillon Tulip. I allowed the glass I poured to sit for 15 minutes to sort of liven up a bit and just sort of chill the fuck out. It was bottled like 10 years ago...best let this beast chill! The cork was perfectly intact but had escaped out of the bottle by a couple of centimeters. The cage held up great.



A - Appearance is on par with Oude Gueuze Vintage 2002-2005 era. Mahogany oak and minor orange notes. A more reddish brown than gueuze being released today. Is that just age? Probably not because the 20 year old gueuze I’ve had from others wasn’t this dark. The cork whisper heavily but did not explode or gush thankfully.



S - There are a few levels to this nose. You can do a one ounce pour, swish heavily and you get this blossom or oranges, lemon skin, wet hay and musty fecal aromas. Then if you let the beer chill out for a bit, it’s this cheesy old shoe with what I’d consider to be the cheesiest basement aroma like the moldiest old stone basement. Something to consider at this age though is storage conditions.If it was kept in an old damp basement, that will certainly influence the nose.



T - This is probably the most orange and lemon forward gueuze I’ve ever had. It’s also the most moldy wet blanket gueuze I’ve ever had. I’m reviewing this beer over a few glasses so I can get the full effect. It’s not really sour, more tart like a lemon, fruity like clementines and moldy, funky just leathery wet hay. It is the most ""rotten"" tasting gueuze I’ve ever had and, to that effect, I freaking love it!



M - The carbonation is as I expected. Not a huge explosion just a nice cork wisp with a 1 finger head that faded slowly. The beer still explodes nicely on a heavy swish with a Harbaugh approved 15% carbonation (do I really have to explain to him what that means? He’s a freaking science teacher right?) Lingering rotten grapefruit rind sticks around.



O - For what Blauw is trading for now, it’s slowly moving past its prime. The first review was in May of 2005. So that well debated 10 year fall off that Drie Fonteinen gueuze has is starting to hit. I want to say the mold / damp hay I get is totally because of storage conditions which is understandable. Is this worth a case of Framboos? No way. It’s still really freaking delicious and hopefully people rating it now get to have more than an ounce of it. It’s best shared 2-3 ways like most 75CL Gueuze. Amazing this is a whale now but age & bottles in circulation will do that. Personally, Golden Blend, Armand & Tomme, Lente, Zomer and 2007 Oude Gueuze Vintage score higher than this in my book but for different reasons. They’re all younger than this beer and brighter. I prefer them to this but this gueuze was still an experience worth going through."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(1, 43)",4.9,"Enjoyed July 13, 2013. Poured from a basket into a Drie Fonteinen stem. Cork shot out with a pop, and gushed about 2 ounces. Have glasses ready! Pours a mildly hazy, golden orange with three plus fingers of sticky, frothy white head. Lots of retention, and lacing. Smell is stunning. Overly ripe peaches and apricots, lemon rind, and a deep earthy funk. Incredibly well balanced and integrated. As it warms, the funk evolves, opening up with barnyard and minerally earth. The stone fruits become more prominent and tropical. I could smell this forever. Taste is bright peach flesh, funk, and tropical sour fruits. Some lemon rind. Lightly sweet. The funk becomes more pronounced as it warms, yet never overpowers the beautiful fruit aspect. Truly incredible how vibrant this is after 10 years. Despite being a massive gusher, this was perfectly carbonated. The balance of flavors lends this to be incredibly drinkable and refreshing. Simply, this beer was nearly flawless, and probably the best beer I’ve ever had the pleasure to enjoy. Vibrant in every way, yet utterly balanced."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(1, 44)",4.5,"75cl bottle at Akkurat as Gold Gueuze 50/50. It pours a golden/light amber colour with a nice white head. Aroma is nice and complex: wet wood, strong funkyness with fruitiness and some spiciness. Nice acidic notes, recalling the classic cheesey and horseblankety notes. Taste is rich and probably as complex as it gets, every sip is a different note, stunning. Strong funkyness again and tartness sorrounded by a sort of yogurt-like sweetness. Huge citrus and lemon peel notes. Grassy notes in the background. Some wood and fruit too. Mostly dry finish. Palate is creamy, silky, with good carbonation. Amazing complexity and drinkability. Feels like this is a mature world class Gueuze, but not sure it tops the Millennium."

Pours hazy orange with a white head that leaves thin lace. The nose is classic, cheesy 3 Fonteinen funk, tons of citrus and white wine vinegar, and a bit more malt than some Gueuzes that I have had. The flavor is very dry, nicely sour, and orange zest with a touch of oxidation actually adding complexity to this brew. The body is medium with some tannic texture, light carbonation, and a very long, sour and complex finish."

Taste is grapefruit, lemon and citrus, sour white fruit, crumbly light blue cheese, mushrooms, rustic barnyard oaky funk. Sparkling, medium palate, soft carbonation. Balanced, very complex, an incredible geuze. One of the best for me."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(1, 54)",4.5,"Sampled at the CCB/RateBeer/Pre-Hunah Tasting (Tampa, FL). Pours a nice richer hazy golden amber pour, darker body, nice glow, with frothy offwhite head atop. Good aromas offer lemon, melon, and gentle white grape.

Not as tart as I had anticipated, but not that isn’t neccisarily bad.  Good amount of sourness and acidity upfront with some lemon, some yogurt character towards the finish.  Nice puckering finish that goes on forever.  Really, really good beer, and I’m happy to share this with a couple good buddies and the girlfriend."

3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(1, 60)",4.7,"October 28th 2012: Bottle (750 ml). Shared by David Paquet, huge thanks David! Unclear orange with a medium diminishing white head that leave’s a small forever lasting white head and superb lacing. Beautiful beer!  Aroma is lemony with herbal/floral notes and mild Gueuze aroma characteristics. Taste is incredibly smooth and wonderfully complex. Fruits (lemon, grapefruit, apple, pineapple), wood, barnyard and leather. Dry and citric mouthfeel. Well carbonated. Except for the aroma that could have been a little more complex (probably mellowed with age though), there’s no flaws in this beer. Perfect balance, amazing complexity and great drinkability . It’s the nearest thing from a perfect Gueuze (and beer) that I’ve drank so far. The saddest things about this beer is that it would be the perfect ""go to"" gueuze but it’s rarer than Pope’s sh**.  

Updated: Bottle (750 ml). Tasted again at De Heeren van Liedekercke on April 20th 2014 just before Roze and Heerengueuze. My rating stay the same as the one up here. It was a little less bright and fresh (probably because of the bottle variation more than the age because there was no other sign of age in this one), but still one of the most amazing gueuze ever made. Near perfection."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(1, 61)",4.1,"Bottle @ THE Sour and Saison Tasting. The pour’s deep, hazy gold with a massive white head. Lively indeed. The nose is sharp lemon peel, sweaty sock, dank basement and a bit of dusty cork. Very earthy, musty aromas. The taste is more musty dust and buggy wood. Some light sweet lactic lemon cake. Barnyard yeastiness, hints of meaty grapefruit and lemon pith. A bit of cheddar cheese. Soft, complex flavors. Wonderful, but the taste is a bit muted and lacks some of the vitality I was expecting. Smooth and very drinkable. Active carbonation on the palate. Overall, a very pleasant experience. This bottle felt like it was starting its decline. Still, very good."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(1, 62)",3.9,"Bottle, thanks to jackl at THE sour tasting (part 1). It pours hazy amber, with a gigantic off-white head. The nose is faint spice, light sulphur, grapefruit, lemon, sweetness in the background, floral, damp wood, dusty and cork. The taste is wood, sour lemon, grapefruit, pomello, lime, pithy, some acidity, dough, spice, sherbet and wood, with a dry finish. Medium body, fairly lively carbonation and foamy mouth-feel. Pretty big on the grapefruit. Tasty and well-balanced. A great blend, but feels a bit tired, a touch over the hill perhaps (this specific bottle anyway)? Still a great gueuzey experience."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(1, 63)",4.4,"And this is what Sean finished the tasting with. Had this back to back with the Roze. 750 ml bottle served in a Portsmouth tulip.

A: Much darker amber color than the Roze. A nice frothy white head forms on the pour and slowly recedes to a thick collar and thin cap. Splotchy lace is left behind.

S: Sour raspberry, tart cherries and some oak. Light sweetness and mild funk as well. blends really nicely together.

T: Dark sour cherry with a nice pucker. Almost like a warhead candy with out the artificial sugar flavors. Tart raspberry, vanilla sweetness, some woody oak and nice funky cheese on the finish.

M: Light bodied with a crisp, drying mouthfeel. The sourness gets in there gives you a nice pucker. A real jowl hitter.

O: I enjoyed this just a tad more than the Roze as it had more a sour kick to it. The Roze was more vibrant, but this beer went deeper in flavor. Huge thanks again to Sean (Sean9689) for sharing this rarity!!

Original review: 25 January 2010

Thanks Brad!

Tasted along with the J&J Roos.

A: Gorgeous. Hazy orange. Pretty lacing.

S: Hay, straw, barnyard funk, citrus.

T: Sourness, balanced to perfection. Subtle lemons, grapefruit, a touch of wood. This is a seriously complex beer and a work of art. The beer seeps into your cheeks with a fine warming sensation and the sourness nestles in beautifully. Every aspect of the taste is simply right on the money.

M: Smooth, no bitterness or sharpness. Acidity is spot on. Lasting finish. Perfect carbonation.

D: Goes down so easy. I could drink this all night. I hope I get to try this again someday."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(1, 82)",4.9,"Bottle at Mikkeller Bar. My jaw totally dropped upon seeing the bottle. Hazy amber liquid with huge off-white head. Aroma is nicely funky and sour with notes of funk, apples, funk, wheat, funk, lemons, barnyard and sweat. Extremely well balanced with huge amounts of funk. Best lambic aroma I’ve ever experienced. Taste is dry and medium sour with notes of apples and lemons. Also very balanced and super drinkable even though it has a nice sourness. Medium bodied with high carbonation and really thirst quenching mouthfeel. This beer is just a perfect as a gueuze could be. Totally worth the hype, 100 times over."

Despita that - beer was still in a perfect condition drank it paired with a first course based on tuna and a Danish smeus as the main course)... Now the beer: pours hazy golden orange with constant and continuous creamy white head (looks like beaten egg whites). Aroma of wood (and plenty of it), some green herbs (cresson, parcely) and spices (I had some cloves and thyme). Medium body with fresh yet very subtle acidity which pushes its way through from the middle to finish extremely dry. Taste is again some wood, citrussy notes.

Re-rated 22/02/2014 at Jeffo’s place. This is just perfection. Sampled this next to other gueuzes and this one simply stood out in balance between funkiness, subtle sourness and - yes - bitterness and what a looooong aftertaste. Just magnificent. Passed from 4.7 to 5."

Hazy golden/orange, with a tiny white head. More sour than the Roze, and definitely more ""manly"", there are no flower notes like Roze, just the typical geuze characteristics, of the finest type though. Lemon and grapefruit, fruity, nice malt base, vinegar, barnyard, cellar, wet wood, such a complexity packed in a perfectly balanced beer.  And what a perfect beer to finish the night with.

3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 12)",4.5,"HUGE thanks to Kramer for bringing both Blauw and Roos to Ffej of July IX and allowing me to knock off a pair of long time wants. Blauw first, Roos second.




A - Pours murky reddish orange with a huge two finger tall bright white head, dissipating down to a light film, leaving thin wisps of lace down the glass.




S - Smells of funky basement must, barn yard hay, lemon peel, sour apples, drying oak tannins, and a bright acidic tartness. It kind of smells like ripe cheese with a bit of tartness thrown in. Very nice.




T - Starts off with a big, sharp, acidic kick quickly giving way to a mix of musty funk, wet hay, lemon zest, granny smith apples, and drying oak tannins. The sourness is strong initially but it quickly gets enveloped by the strong barnyard funk. The finish is bone dry, lingering for some time.




M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Tart, funky, feel with lots of dryness in the finish. It has an good balance of funk to tart throughout.




O - While I personally preferred the sharp tartness of the Roos to the funky must of the Blauw, this is still an excellent beer. They truly are the perfect complement to each other. Hope I get to try this one again in the future. Thanks again Kramer!"

Pours with a nice golden hue and a single-finger white head with some good retention as well as a good dose of lacing and a nice collar after that settles down. Light carbonation bubbles atop the beer throughout. How long they would have stayed, I’m not all that sure--try as I might to drink this slowly, I couldn’t really help myself. The nose was quite funky with a bit of sourness. A nice oak presence and a lot of horse blanket. This was just extremely pungent.

The taste had some really nice lactic character as well as musty basement notes and some lemon. Good barnyard-y hay character and a slight woodiness. The mouthfeel was quite dry with just enough carbonation. Excellent funk presence throughout with a good amount of sourness to balance. Amazingly complex, this was a bottle I could have consumed all of, and am glad we opened this outside without losing any, especially given the fact that I believe the cork shot out a good 25 feet or more. Cheers, Eric.

3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 31)",4.4,"Served at a tasting, side by side, with the J&J Roos. First thing is first. The labels of these beers are great. Oil paintings of a silhouette of a nude female torso profile, its just such a pretty painting. I understand that these beers were originally brewed for the brewer’s wedding and the roos was for the wife (naked woman on the label) and the Blau was for the husband (naked man on the label). Great concept.

Beer is yellow and hazy, just like the other one. Head is small bubbles, white to off white.

Aroma is a strong funk and completely sour. More funky than the Roos but still amazing smelling.

There is a lot of citric based sour in this beer. This reminds me a lot of a Cantillon Helena but totally different. Beer is tart and there is a slight sulfur taste really late. Overall this beer is very similar to the Roos, slightly less sour, slightly more funk, and there’s some sulfur in the palate. I understand that most people like the Blau over the Roos but I’m the opposite. Both are great but the Roos is slightly better.

3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 32)",4.3,"Bottle graciously provided by Eric, redeeming my De Heeren experience that left me speechless and without a drop of their special nectars. Sadly the beer itself didn’t redeem my experience, maybe too high of expectations on my part but based upon the seasoned palate of Alex and Sean who shared that their previous bottle was much better, it might be high time to drink these bad boys up. Especially considering this beer was about a month old straight ouf of De Heeren where you presume they are being stored at proper conditions and not waste deep in a flooded basement or off site completely. But I digress(if you want the full store just bm me)....As everyone mentioned, be prepared when opening, highly carbonated. Golden pour with a decent amount of head, not as much as you would expect though, a good thing. Good retention and lacing...A decent nose of funkyiness but it its weirdly acidic and stale to me. Lots of oak was surprising, sterile in a weird way for me...Taste was slightly better but still a sterile presence to it, inhibited in some way. Oak, lactic, sour horse blanket. The right players are there, just not working completely. Don’t get me wrong this is still an excellent beer, but I was expecting in the range of Loerik and it was more in the range of Oude Gueze Vintage. The taste is more of a 4.25 but just can’t give it a 4.5.

A beer worth trying for sure but starting down the wrong side of excellent."

Even after Beatification and the De Cam Oude Lambiek just ahead of it, this stands head-and-shoulders above the other two. THE finest nose I’ve ever had on a sour beer. As it warms, oregano and basil notes, along with parsley start to emerge. Flavours of horse, earth, exceedingly rich-tasting, my glass took me nearly half an hour to finish.

Pours a hazy, orange color and topped by a thick, pillowy head of off white foam that slowly recedes and leaves thick rings of lacing around the glass. The aroma is really nice and funky showing notes of sour citrus fruit and acidity from the likes of orange, grapefruit, and lemons. The musty, horse blanket barnyard yeast lends a funky, spicy, earthy quality as well. The oak barrel imparts some vanilla that smooths out the citric acidity. The flavor follows with the intense sour citrus acidity with the lemons, grapefruits, and some soft peach pushing their way through. Some white grapes and tannins from the oak come next and seem to balance out the intense sourness. The funky, barnyard yeast really shines though and lends some earthiness to it all.

Aroma is heavy malt (straw, hay, meal), light hops (spicy), and average esters (grape) with notes of wine, horse blanket, faint black walnuts, blueberry; simply amazing.  Flavor is a complex marriage of heavy malt (straw, hay, bread crust), light hops (spicy, floral), and average esters (grape) with notes of wine, horse blanket, faint black walnuts, and blueberry; slightly tart.  Medium body, light warmth, medium-high carbonation, light creaminess and a pleasant dry finish."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 45)",4.7,Bottle. Nice pop from the cork as the cage is released. Pours a slightly hazed orange yellow with a big fluffy white head that slowly recedes. Pretty funky floral aroma with nice touches of some fruit. Oaky and earthy with some nice fruit almost like blueberry as well.  Decently sour and tart with a nice lemony zest type taste but balanced with other fruit like sweetness. Hints of oak and earth. Light mouthfeel. This is an amazing beer with lots of depth. Some peach as well. Ends rather cleanly.
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 46)",4.1,"A big thanks to Marc for hooking us up at the LCBS 10.  A cloudy straw color with aromas of funk and lemon permeating the air.  The taste was semi-sweet with sour cherries, lemon, and vinegar carrying the load....."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 47)",4.2,"2003 Vintage Bottle thanks to ditmier for sharing this special treat. Pours out a cloudy straw topped with a white head. Aroma was very complex with lemon zest, oak, apple, funk, and some leather. Taste was more of the same oak and light lemon along with some dust, white grape."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 48)",4.1,"Sample (about 6 ounces) at De Heeren van Liedekerke for about 3 euro (yep!). Pours a cloudy copper color with a huge white head. The aroma is sour barrels, huge wood, yeast. The flavor is wonderful; a tart acidic attack is fought off by oak and dry yeast. Some fruity and somehow lots of all the flavors. Wonderful. A treat. A vibrant palate."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 49)",4.8,"- The cork pops out loudly and we were are a little surprised by the bottle gushing. This beer is almost 7 years old and still has plenty of carbonation. Pours copper gold with a pillowy white head that leaves a web and decent lacing.

S - Blauw brings the funk, a soaking wet horse rolling on a blue cheese blanket in a barn. The citric aroma of lemon peel is there with a light oak.

T - A perfect balance is what describes the taste. Not as funky as the nose, nice lemon, oak, white grapes, with a tannic finish.

M/D - high carbonation, tannic dry finish, with decent acidity that does not wear on the palate. The only reason I stopped sipping on this beer was to enjoy the assortment of funky cheeses.

A beautiful blend of lambics that has easily stood up to 7 years, and my favorite gueuze to date."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 50)",4.6,"Bottle shared with the wife on August 12 2010 at De Heeren van Liedekerke.



A: Inviting golden, pale-amber colored body with was capped by a beautiful craggy off-white head. Lasted for quite sometime and left a healthy dose of soap-like lace.



S: The only thing that outdoes the lemon-lactic citric nature of this beer is the massive musty, oak funk that permeates the immediate area surrounding the freshly opened bottle. Certainly inviting to any gueuze-head.



T: Magnificent. A well balanced performance is put on by the lemon, oak, must, wheat, and tart notes here. This bottle demonstrates why great geuze can be cellared for years.



M: Quite the effervescent treat here. Loads of carbonation delivers the flavors to the tongue with each sip. Bone dry finish with a healthy, but not overpowering tartness.



O: An undeniably great geuze. Traveling out to DHVL is also a great part of the experience!"
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 51)",4.2,"Bottle merci à Boutip. Hazy beige with a huge white head with great retention and beautiful lacing. Aroma is funky and complex with wet leather, wood, horse blanket, barnyard, malt, herbal notes, tartness and some fruity notes.

3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 52)",4.4,"Pours an hazy orange color with a big white foamy head. Looks really nice! Aroma is filled with wet leather, funky barnyard notes and some dry oak. Tart with some grapefruit. Really musty and big aroma which leaves an impression! Taste is more of the same, plenty of grapefruit notes. Balanced acidity with plenty of oaky notes. Two words: Barnyard&Complex!  Carbonation is perfect. WOW!"
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 53)",4.2,Bottle: Poured a dirty cloudy beige color lambic with a huge foamy head with great retention and some really good lacing. Aroma of oak with funky notes of wet leather and barnyard notes is quite sublime. Taste is a very nice complex mix between some acidity similar to what can be found in green apples as well as some oak and barn yard notes. Flavors are very well balanced with good carbonation even though bottle is 7 years old. Even though this is great it still feels to be slightly inferior to the regular Oude Gueuze from 1999 which in my book is still one of the best beer around the world.
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 54)",4,"This was shared by mreusch, thanks Matt but I also had a bottle I picked up at the spot and saved to share with Brandon.  The cork explodes, has some crude around it. The beer is a bit of a gusher, this a thick head, which isn’t loud.  Don’t know how 3 Fonteinen does it but that signature rubber tire/burnt rubber is all over but there is also a very earthy character (maybe its the age).  This is a burnt gueze character, thick.  Flavor is more burnt rubber but fades quickly. Some sweetness (for a lambic) and a calmed body for the style.  Nice stuff."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 55)",4.4,"2000 ticks!  Hell yeah!  750ml bottle thanks to alfrantzell on BA and RB.  The cork exploded out of the bottle.  Pours hazy golden in color with a gigantic white head that lasts.  Good lacing.  Amazing gueuze aroma: funky, musty, and oaky with a slight sulfuric note.  Like an amazing gueuze.  Flavor is also excellent.  A little funky with a subtle malt note and lots of barnyard funk.  A little cheesiness even, but in a good way.  Lots of oak and slight tannins.  Just a little residual sweetness.  Dry on the palate with good medium acidity and fairly high carbonation.  Really awesome stuff overall."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 56)",4.4,"Huge thanks to beastiefan2k for sharing this, what was likely my most sought-after want (what will replace it?’)- celebrated my son’s first birthday a little early with this one - lovely, lively turbid gold, with a thick, rocky head - a lot of cork hits the nose first, followed by light leather, oak, and a surprising subdued wheat and light sweetness - soft carbonation in the mouth - dry and tart, but not overpoweringly so - very present and complex funk, but again, very balanced - every element works fairly harmoniously; no one quality dominates - lingering oak and light acetic character on the tail end - complex and palate-challenging, but insanely drinkable (I could easily polish off a 750 of this by myself) - thanks again, Eugene!"

3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 59)",3.9,"Pours sort of golden apricot pink copper with white head. The aroma seems smooth and its subtleness defies its fullness. It has points of tartness, tannin like fruit skin, yeasty spice, apricots and tart un ripe cherries. The taste begins neutral for a moment before sour and tart notes seem to attach all at once. It seems to become sour citrus and assorted fruity sourness to midway and then drying out right into the finish. Into the after taste I get supportive notes of muted spices and earthiness leaving a nice dry palate. I also get a growing Brett like quality after a few ounces go down."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 60)",4.6,"Unbelievable pour, each time I’ve been lucky enough to try this beer I’ve been shocked by the creamy rich head that lasts for days.  The nose is one of the funkiest I’ve ever smelled, and the beer is not nearly as tart as I expected.  The flavor is a complex mix of some lemon peel, earthy and barnyard funk, and a nice yogurt character."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 61)",4.8,"Huge thank you to cpferris.  This was one of the best beers that I’ve ever tried.  It looked great - hazy, yellow liquid with a surprisingly nice head.  The aroma was fantastic - complex, sour and earthy.  In a good way, it smelled like old books, lemon peels and acorns.  Lots of oak and sour were apparent.  The flavor was possibly even better.  The sour wasn’t overpowering but inviting and interesting.  It starts with sweetness and acidity but finishes quite dry.  Great funk.  Gentle feel.  An absolutely excellent gueuze."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 62)",4.7,"Re-reviewed at Akkurat next to millennium, blauw, and other main players.  Pour is golden yellow, hazy, thin white head with big gentle bubbles.  Very light funk, paper and dusty cobweb, salty and rindy with light hint of soap.  Golden fruits behind, sour and citrusy, fantastic balance.  Flavor actually falls off slightly, still great.  Dusty, salty up front with cheese rind notes and lots of mineral mid palate.  Good golden fruits, rather bright and nice level of sourness.  Light body, soft palate, highly carbonated and nice dry finish.  Such a great beer and still holding up incredibly well, had several bottles throughout the trip and each was great.

Big thanks to Kevin for sharing this at the Epic tasting where he, Frank, and Jeremy really shook the groud we sat on with insane beers.

A-dark hazy golden amber color with orange edges and tons of a tight creamy head with a spotty lace.

S-the nose brings a yeasty funkiness with notes of an earthy mushroom and cheese.  a lemon tartness comes in towards the back.

T-the funky earthy musk is right up front, notes of aged cheese and chardonnay, tart white grapes, soft peaches, with a touch of sweetness.  acidity comes in at the finish with the lemon from the nose.

M-great feel, a little grainy, huge carbonation with a crisp finish and solid body throughout.

D-extremely tasty with the highest utmost complexity.  subtle flavors ranging all over the map but truly working together.  couldn’t drink a ton of this; but this is insanely well done."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 63)",4.7,"In short: An intense and very funky gueuze (even by gueuze standards)

How: Bottle at DHVL.  Consumed when about 6 year of age 

The look: Cloudy dark blonde body topped by a large off-white head

In long: Nose is very funky, even by Geuzes standards.  The aroma is very barnyard, old carpet, funk dust, etc.  Taste is very intense.  High Acidity, high sourness, lots of funk, horse blanket, fruit skin, some sawdust.  A lot less wood but a lot more “wild stuff” than in its Roze sister.  I had the beer twice in tastings but wanted to have a full bottle by myself before I rate it.  I was hoping for the greatest gueuze ever, not quite, but this is one worth the hype nonetheless.  Without a doubt one of the best gueuze I’ve had.  Blue is a nice masculine color.  The color that this rating appear.  Except for those with abnormally high estrogens level.  To those the rating appears black."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 64)",4.5,"Bottled sample, consumed at De Heeren van Liedekercke. Tarnished gold in colour with very strong carbonation. Loads of leathery barnyard funk, sharp fragrant lemon, and earthy old wood on the nose. The funk and citrus dominate the palate with a spicy exotic wood note coming through on the finish. Delicate body, but full of flavour and acidic zip. A very special beer."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 65)",4.9,"Drank next to the ’02 Vintage. Cork blasted off but there was only the smallest amount lost before pouring a rich gold body with large, unshakable fluffy white head. “Funk” is a vague word, but it best describes perhaps the most complex nose I’ve sniffed in a geuze, the first 6-7 swirls each giving a new element: mushroom, earth, leaves and grass, lemon, lime, leather. The flavor keeps this up, trading element after element in a funky earth way that never compromises yet never breaks from the balance. Like Mingus leading a 10-piece band, this is at once chaotic and sublime while simultaneously tight as all hell and brooding like sin. The massive funk rules out any easy fruit acidity or pale malt as havens to run for when expecting a traditional lambic. By my experience, this is geuze at its most hardcore and earthy. I could imagine studying this one for a lifetime, that is if I could get another bottle."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 66)",4.7,"2003 Bottle - Courtesy of one kick ass trader, thanks!!!  ad to work at the cork for a bit, but I guess thats just the price you pay for a 7 year old gueuze...Opens with a pop and only a fair amount of head rising up the neck, but you bet you ass we were prepared for 10x worse...Pours a hazy golden with a large eggshell head that dissipates...aroma is just mouthwatering, lemon, dust, earth, tannic oak and massive acidity...flavour is similar, lemon, dirt, grain...finish is lingering acidity, not a hint of vinegar, just intensely sour...pricky carbonation initially in the glass, but after 15-20 minutes it’s almost still...I would love to be more descriptive, but I think I lack the vocab and palate to describe everything...I guess the only way I can describe it adequately is that if you dream about what your perfect notion of a gueuze tastes like, this is probably as close to that idea as you can get...Thanks again mate!!"
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 67)",5,"Bottle shared by 3/4.  My holy grail.  The Blue.  Finally.  Thanks Mike!  This did not disappoint.  It was a gusher!  Can you believe it?  But Mike and Kevin were there for the save.  Poured out of a whicker basket--very classy.  Pours hazy orange with a thick white head and very nice carbonation that created a nice mouthfeel.  Nose of horseblanket, cobwebs, must, citrus, very well developed sourness.  Incredibly well rounded flavor-maybe the best blend I have had. Compares to the 98 (50th anniversary) and some of the better ’99’s I have had. So incredibly smooth, sour and almost creamy at times.  A masterpiece. 





Had this again a couple nights ago.  It was my fourth beer of a
50+ bottle share and it more than stood out as the best.  This beer may be a it’s best right now."

It really couldn’t get any better to have this brew at the venue it was brewed for.  Full of dust in the nose.  Dry and fruity.  The dryness and mustiness continues in the flavor, making one of the better gueuzes on the planet.  Everything you could ask for.  This sets the benchmark for gueuze.  Fantastic."

Cork pops to the ceiling and a bit spills, but no matter, everyone gets some.   Pours hazy golden with a frothy white head.  A swirl in the glass and a whiff reveals a savory, infinitely complex nose of sour hay, earth, barnyard, some mint leaf, hints of lemon rind, light oak, words can only go so far in describing this panacea .  I take a good ten minutes to swirl and re-waft, but finally I delve in and the flavor lives up to the aroma entirely.  Horse sweat, funk, barnyard, sour hay, at the first then a Extremely smooth tart and lemon rind follow in a subtle transition.  
Oaked like a transcendent chardonnay, light tannins perk up my pallate.  creamy mouthfeel adds even more to the experience.  An extremely smooth and layered geuze  The end all be all for me personally.  Once I get a bottle of my own Im sure I will give it a 5.0"

Taste is the bright lemon citrus, vinegar, and the same plastic of the nose. The finish is lingering with the vinegar. Palate is active carbonation, light bodied, with a plastic mineral aftertaste. Nice, thanks for sharing this one Matt."

Flavor does more to up the ante, with more delicate and gentle blending of funk, wood, fruit, and just a hint of acid.  Wow, this is so gentle, delicate, nuanced and well blended it’s scary.

3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 76)",4.7,"Cork bangs off, pours a clear medium orange/gold with a tempestuous head that just stick around the upper regions of the glass.  Epic.  Big, funky nose full of light fruits, slightly vinous.  A bit light and tingly on the nose.  Crisp, snappy, and lively in the mouth.  Tight, dry, but wondrously rich and full-bodied.  Not the most funky or sour geuze out there, but just so refined, balanced, and lively.  Light oranges, lemons dance about a musty barnyard funk.  Near perfect really, and  absolutely delightful.*********************After fantasizing about this beer for the past few weeks, the thing that struck me the most was the really lively, vibrant lime and lemon which kind of fizzed throughout the whole thing.  This quality really reminds me of batch 3 Sanctification (the really good batch), so that’s the closest comparison I would have to this wonderful beverage."

Bottle from that unholiest of beer purchasing websites.  Nose starts huge right out of the bottle: feet, sweat, prickly yeast, that nice dried hop character, faint vanilla, sweet wood.  Color is a hazy, effervescent gold with a fat fluffy white head.  Stays active in the bottle such that it pushes up bubbles for twenty minutes after opening.  This is the smoothest gueuze I have ever had, and for me that takes away from the overall.  Flavor has those smooth hops, very very light creaminess, faint wheat and yeast.  Minimum acidity, minimal bacterial qualities.  Perfectly stored, I bet."

Very dry tart sour funky medium body that is amazingly puckering without being acidic. I thought that this would be really harsh and painful in my stomach but it is incredibly drinkable with a lots of crisp lift fruit notes, especially apple and vinous grape as well as a strong vinegary puckering aftertaste that leaves me salivating for more.

3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 81)",4.5,"Oh. My. God. Sampled at DC Local tasting. Thank you Brad!!! You rock! This geuze is absurd. First, it reminds me a ton of Girardin Black Label but is better in every way.It pours super hazy bright yellowish orange with a healthy, thick, poofy white head that has crazy lacing and retention. This beer is from 2003!!! The best word to describe this beer is BRIGHT. The colors of it in the glass are almost neon and flavors explode out of the vessel. You can smell of its nuances from a few feet away. What!? There is no horse blanket, sweat, or funkiness to me. Instead there is ultra fresh grapefruit rind, curacao, blood orange, and white pepper in the nose. Super fresh, citrusy, and tart. Taste is similar. Super sour but not astringent or overpowering. It is a very refined sour that complements the citrus flavors and almost lemon/lime thirst quenching character. It is so spectacular that you really don’t want to sit down and write down what you thought about it. You just want to savor it and thank Jesus that such a fantastic creation exists on this planet. 

My second sample of this rarity- it stills pours perfectly with a huge, dense, white head that leaves excellent lace. All atop a deep rose/orange body. Aroma is insane bright citrus, lots of lavender, hibiscus, fresh cut flowers, lots of white peppery Brett, curacao, grapefruit peel, sweat. Awesome. Taste is so good but not quite the superlative that I would give the 3F 1999 Geuze. It is fluffier, drier, more full of Brett than the massive lactic / unblended character the 1999 exhibits."

Congratulations even though it is some time ago now. The blend og the lambic is so good. It’s balanced and mild but at the same time agressive and bitter. Without a doubt one of the best gueuzes I ever had. It appears light shady yellow with an impressive with crown on top. The aroma is classic grapefruit-like - very nice. The taste is also classic with a capital C and balanced as hell. Its sparkling with a light buttery palate. Thank you for this one.

Holy shit, Alex just tried to kill Dave while opening this one! This one is a gusher! Luckily, Dave didn’t die but the only problem is he went after the cat who was sprayed with the Blauw nectar. The cat made it out alive, but I can’t look at Dave the same ever again.

A - Pours mirky burnt orange with a HUGE white fizzy head. I had to let this one settle down a bit before pouring some more into my glass. The head on this one is crazy-big! Lots of sticky white lacing is left behind by the enormous head.

S - Holy super-funk! I thought I knew about funk until I poured this beer and took a whiff. I now have a new appreciation for all that is funk from Brouwerij Drie Fonteinen! Lost of stinky cheese notes but really all I can say is FUNK!

T - Uh...funk? Yeah, that’s it! Very acidic as well along with some lemon citrus notes. Not quite as mind-blowing as the smell, but excellent, nonetheless. 

M - Light boded. SUPER DRY...in fact, the liquid absorbs the saliva in your mouth and then tries to turn your face inside out. Okay, maybe not that bad, but it has a very dry finish. Nice fizzy carbonation which is champagne-esk and works well with this beer.

D - Not as drinkable as the previous two wilds I just had simply because my palate would be stripped of all taste buds after finishing this bottle. However, it’s an oustanding beer."

Aroma has tons of barnyard and brett, loads of lactic acid, as it warms, tons of bitter grapefruit peel come forward. Really a rich and full aroma with a surprising amount of sweetness still evident. Flavor is quite tart and sour, but not nearly the most sour I’ve had. Somehow the beer manages to be dry and sweet at the same time. The flavor has lots of bitter grapefruit peel, various citric fruit rinds, funk, and lots of other citric juciness. Full mouthfeel and surprisingly smooth and creamy. The yeast pour doesn’t change the beer a whole lot other than to add a little more citrus to the nose and a little more creaminess to the mouthfeel.

An incredible minerality to the nose. Rotten orange peel. As it warms, the orange peel turns to a grapefruit note. Loads of dirty, funky, wet-animal like sharpness. Old cedar. Wow. Pours a glowing, hazed dark orange with a pillowy, fluffy, lasting eggshell white head. Flavor is insanely sharp, funky and dry. Absolutely zero residual sweetness. Stones, gravel... Leather. Sharp, sharp acid. Long aged cheese and earthy mushrooms. A slight hint of tangy smoke. Moist cedar wood. Wet wood tannin all over the sides and especially the back of the tongue.  The palate is full of intense and stingy acid. Lively, but not overbearing carbonation. Once past the carbonation, the texture is fairly creamy. 


 Wos! Wow! Wow! Intense and satisfying. This one is hittin’ on all levels. Tons and tons of life left in this one. If I could give a 20 for aroma, I would. Absolutely one of the best beers I have ever nose. Thanks a ton for making this possible Jesper!"

Flavour is woody, earthy and very tart. Has yeasty and grapy notes. Is medium to full bodied. Very dry. Fantastic grapish sourness is all over the palate in the end.  I have saved this for my birthday, and it really is a treat. Smooth and refreshing. So nice."

Very complex and almost burning/warming taste. Powerfull and well made."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 97)",4.7,"Massive thanks to Jan for sharing this rarity and what better bottle to celebrate Fathers Day and review #900.

The cork pops with some serious power and we have a gusher!  Not much lost, but I’m glad I had a glass ready to go as the foam started pouring out.  It’s a hazy orange with an initial head that’s taller than the beer in the glass itself.  The head recedes slowly, leaves very good lacing and stays on as a bubbly collar for the duration.

The aroma is massive and jumps out of the bottle.  It’s all about the funk in the nose - a combination of mustiness and barnyard aromas that dominates the nose.  There are lighter sour apple and tart lemon notes but the funk is the major player in the nose.

The taste is nothing short of sublime.  It extremely complex but very well-balanced.  It starts with a tart lemony zing but also has more sweet fruits than the aroma, with apples and pears.  On top of that is a yeast presence that I didn’t get in the aroma which lends a slight spiciness to the proceedings.  The funk comes back and leaves a big dry and musty finish.

Mouthfeel is very dry and wine-like with tons of carbonation and lots of tartness and funk that leaves the palate tingling throughout.

Well, I’ve been late to the sour craze and I have struggled sometimes to get the complexity and overall quality of some of the funky beers I’ve tasted.  I didn’t have that problem here.  This is probably the best sour I’ve ever had and.  It’s got everything you’d want in a good sour - tartness, funk, fruit and in all the right doses.  Outstanding."
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 98)",4.5,"Bottle@home. The bottle looks really great, the beer in the glass also. Starts complex-sourish with woody notes, not too intense. Strong, modest dry in the background. Sourish taste turns almost spicy in the finish. Very well balanced, great warming aftertaste. A masterpiece!"
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw,"(2, 99)",4,"Courtesy of northernbrews @ his November ’08 sour tasting


Bottle:  The aroma has strong presence of musty basement with some light tartness and hints of cork.  It pours a hazy golden-orange with a large off-white head that leaves behind great lacing.  The flavor begins with some sour apple and a hint of cork and mustiness in the background.  The finish has moderate lemon sourness and light oak.  Light bodied with a somewhat spritzy mouthfeel."

Flavor follows, very sharp, tart and sour, lots of acid, super tasty leaving one constantly licking their lips and gums with their tongue.

Overall
A great imperial stout with extreme concentration, however there's too much vanilla and alcohol right now. Need time for all those flavors to melt up.
一款伟大的帝国世涛，有极致的集中度，但现在饮用的话香草味和酒精感过于突出了。需要时间来让所有味道融合在一起。

Really dark roasty coffee, chocolate forward, boozy (!) bourbon/whiskey tone balancing in nicely, medium bitter. As it warms it gets some porto, sweetish red fruity tones, vanilla and toffee.

Full body and moderate carbonation. Shitloads of chocolate, cocoa, focused on soft roast, soft warming alcohol, very well hidden considering the ABV.

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(1, 74)",4.1,"Poured from a 2012 vintage, 750 ml bottle. 
Aroma is a bit oxidized with some light wet cardboard and more raisin, fig, prune and date than when fresher. Medium light roast notes with light chocolate and lighter caramel and toffee. Faint bourbon and oak notes. Not much coffee at all. 
Pours black with a medium sized, thick, dark mocha head that recedes steadily to a small film that lingers on the edges. Faint lacing and fairly long legs. 
Flavor is less oxidized with more chocolate notes. Lighter roast, caramel and toffee. Light coffee notes that linger a bit in the finish. Medium light bourbon and light oak with a bit of alcohol spice. Light raisin and faint fig, prune and date notes. 
Mouthfeel is full bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, this much age isn't good for this beer. I have had it plenty of times fresh or with a couple years and it's much better than this old bottle. But as I was drinking this bottle I went to check my rating and realized I never rated this before. I'd say it's best to drink within 2 or 3 years of bottling. Rating is for what I feel this beer deserves when fresh. This particular bottle would get a 6, 4, 7, 4, 14 for a 3.5."
AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(1, 75)",4.2,"May 10th, 2016 -  Rounding up the trio of Alesmith Stouts and their different flavor variants is the Barrel Aged version of the OG, with a high price, an ABV and my high expectations. The smell is potent, even from a 4 oz. taster glass, and shows off the barrel aging and oak nicely. The flavor is also exceptionally smooth, strong and potent, with a solid hit of alcohol, and a good bourbon taste. Solid, meaty and strong, it's a triple threat, and definitely worth of following the other Speedway styles.

September 3rd, 2015 - The Alesmith Vietnamese Coffee stout is a premier beer, but the Bourbon Barrel Aged version is no slouch. With a smooth, opalescent look it offers classic and classy alcohol and oak notes, smoldering with ethanol. The taste is much gentler, both sweet and delicate, but also bold and robust. A licorice sweetness mixes with the taste of Japanese whisky, and a thinner palate let's everything shine through."
AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(1, 76)",4.6,"On tap. 

Top tier aroma, full of oak barrel and vanilla scent, along with strong cocoa, coffee, roasted malt and bread crust. 

Flavor-wise, well-rounded balanced flavor combining the roasty and malty flavor with bourbon flavor. Nothing really stands out, but all are in one sip, expressing themselves in so many levels. 

Rich and heavy body with a caramel sweetness. I am very impressed with this beer."

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 38)",4.4,"2016 bottle, many thank Max! Black color with small beige head. Aroma is green apples, phenolic, ethanol, oak sugar, chocolate. Taste is again green apples and phenols, oak sugar, light tartness. Higher carbonation than the other Speedways today. Not as good as expected, it?s a bit too phenolic. A slight disappointment for Alesmith standards. Maybe this year was not as great as previous ones? Or maybe I?m becoming a BA grump now as well.



Opens up after a half hour of decanting. Still, not on par with what it should be. 8-5-8-4-16

SABOR: nuevamente dulce y licorosa seguida de una explosión de sabores, de inicio las características de la barrica bien presente, notas a bourbon, vainilla y madera carbonizada, seguido de predominio intenso del sabor a vainilla y caramelo, atrás de ello notas a chocolate semiamargo, fudgie como brownie, caramelo y en ocasiones se alcanza a percibir algo tostado del café pero muy ligeramente. En el retrogusto queda un amargor ligero/medio bajo, con una larga persistencia de notas a bourbon dulce, vainilla, madera y caramelo.

Sensación: cuerpo completo, sensación sedosa en boca, baja carbonatación. El alcohol se percibe en boca pero no llega a ser agresivo, en garganta queda una sensación caliente al pasar el líqiuido.

RESUMEN: cerveza de clase mundial."
AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 46)",4,"Black pour, tan head, good lace/retention. Aroma of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, light coffee and roast, moderate alcohol. The coffee comes off as more muted relative to regular Speedway. Full bodied, creamy, vanilla with chocolate, light coffee flavors. I wouldn’t label this as the 4th (at the time) best rated imperial stout, but it’s still really good."
AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"(2, 47)",4.4,"Three way vertical of ’14, ’15, and ’16 at the brewery last July. Aroma is bourbon and roasted malt. Very warming on the palate. The bourbon flavor is more prevalent in the younger vintages. Finish is boozy and long with lots of malt and bourbon.

Ilyen illatokról eddig ugyanis még nem hallottam, erre nem is lehet felkészülni, már ha sörre számít az ember. Némely bourbon talán képes ilyesmit produkálni, de én már abban sem bízom. Whiskyben ázott fahordó szeletei, vaníliás, kókuszos, kávés fergeteg, mennyei aromák táncra perdülése. Ilyesmi a mesében sincs... Könnyed vonalakkal felvértezett, elegáns szerkezete mérnöki csoda módjára tartja meg a behemótul gazdag szerkezetet, amelyben összepréselődik minden, amit az illatai előjeleznek. Olvasztott csokoládé-vanília-kókusz fagylalt kikönnyített, alkohollá varázsolt verziója, mazsolával megszórt, whiskyvel locsolt kávéfolyam, mennyei malátalikőr. Nem a hétköznapok itala, de hozzá illő alkalom nem sok van egy átlagember életében. A jellemzés megírása itt már kevésnek bizonyul, ezt egyszerűen érezni kell."

Misc.: AleSmith Tap Takeover night

First time reviewing this, but third time tasting it. Picked this over Vietnamese Coffee variant, assuming I would get to have that next (this did not happen). Loved it the last two times I tasted it and expecting at least a 4.50.

Poured a black color with one finger of khaki tan head when I got it. Minima lacing on the sides of the glass. Average retention. (Sight - 3.75)

Smelled toffee, smooth milk chocolate, buttery bourbon syrup, caramel, roasty malts and wet cocoa powder. (Smell - 4.50)

Tasted much boozier than the smell. Super hot from the get-go. Bourbon heavy, chocolate, toffee, caramel and smooth dark milk chocolate. Bourbon was just overwhelming. (Taste - 4.25)

Full body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Boozy, warming finish. (Feel - 4.25)

Not quite as good as the last few times I had this at AleSmith. Not sure what it was, but picked a bad time to review this. Will have it again for sure though. (Overall - 4.25)

Flavor: complex and rich as aroma or even more: prevailing notes of coffee, bourbon, dark malts, hops...they takes on all ingredients, which I mentioned by aroma, but they are perfectly blended in one unit.

I have more of these bottles and will surely trade them for something more complex than this.

Pendant cette longue dégustation, les mots prononcés furent rares et les orgasmes papillaires nombreux. Est-ce le meilleur stout impérial que j’ai bu de ma vie? Peut-être pas, mais il trône fièrement sur l’immense podium de la formidabilité! La bière noire assombri soudainement la terrasse en ce jour précis d’éclipse lunaire. Le liquide est surmonté d’une magnifique et légère mousse blanche que je ne me lasse de contempler. Des dentelles, lacings, formes géométriques diverses et irrégulières... Une Grande complexité au nez où tous ces arômes sont savamment balancés: anis, bourbon, café, mélasse, cassonade brûlée au chalumeau, vanille et noix de pécan rôties. C’est prodigieux! Les signes d’un subtil vieillissement se font sentir mais peu-importe, c’est merveilleux! Texture laiteuse; alcool brun et chaud. Le liquide coule le long de ma langue avec une sensualité à peine ponctuée par une faible pétillance me rappelant qu’il s’agit ici d’une bière. Je passe du massepain à la crème pâtissière en passant par l’éclair au chocolat. Longueur admirable et mesurée laissant les saveurs caramélisées s’étirer longuement et doucement.

Good retention. Boozy smell. Subdued coffee, especially compared to regular Speedway. Decent barrel notes of bourbon and vanilla.

Awesome flavor. Coffee comes through much more. Good chocolate and a great barrel flavor. Tingly bourbon is especially evident in the finish. Hot from the barrel, not necessarily the beer.

Thick and boozy, even if from the barrel, it’s a little harsh. Decent carbonation.

 Nice. Really nice. Maybe not any better than regular Speedway, but the barrel adds a nice dimension."

Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 1)",4.4,"20K rating. 750 bottle thanks to JMFP. Pours a cloudy orange pink with medium white head that lasts. The aroma is strong funk, oak, grape skin. Medium body, welchs grape juice, nice funk, light oak, was a treat to finally tick this. As Charlie says in Always Sunny after beating Boggs, “what do now?”"
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 2)",3.8,"Bottle shared by Brad, (thank you!) on 10/8/16.
High clarity leaving behind the sediment and revealing a sunset-hued golden body with a surprisingly large, white head showing strong retention for the style.
The nose is quite grape-forward, showing what definitely smells very Concord-esque. Many say Welch’s grape jelly, and while I don’t think it’s that uncouth, there’s no denying the similarities. There’s definitely some light powdered sugar evident but the sourness/acidity is quite nicely controlled and it smells soft, mild, even, etc....No alcohol or flaws and not exactly a study in funk, but certainly some mineral, very light horseblanket and light grapeseed suggestions.
Flavor is surprisingly acidic with lots of grapeseed and grapeskin character. These types of grapes are very tannic and it shows here. It’s pretty nicely integrated with the lambic, though it’s still quite prominent. Tart acidity and a very tight, engaging carbonation keep it zesty, bright and refreshing, with soft, malt and wheat backing it. Dry, of course with interesting flavors arising from the combination of grape and lambic, as per usual. Still, I wouldn’t call this terribly funky, certainly not by Cantillon standards. Is that why it’s liked by so many?? That’s definitely not why I like Cantillon...."

Flavor is fairly acidic with some medium light lemon notes. Moderate grape flavor with a bit of sweetness. Some medium light oak notes. Light leather, herbal and barnyard funk. Some lingering tart grape and oak notes.

Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 8)",4.6,Bottle at tasting. Very unique beer with a musty candy fruitiness to both aroma and flavor. The acidity and sourness complements the semi-sweet grape flavors. So complex yet so straightforward. Gentle as an Italian lover but rough like a bearded horse farmer.
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 9)",4.9,"Bottle shared at Mikey’s - 2011 - Murky off-purple pour into cantillon tulip, this is perfection in a glass. Dank aroma of musty grapes, faint funky profile ultimately overpowered by the robust fruit. Extremely heady taste..musky and tart, though not bracing. Like a blended vignerrone and st. Lamvinus with some cobweb and equestrian essence to mellow things out. Big thank you to Franco for the expedited shipping and the opportunity to try this. Thanks also to the kind FedEx customs rep who said she would ""see what she could do"" after it was flagged. Can’t wait to see how this develops over the next decade.

After sharing and tasting many more bottles of this, at Dirty Truth Thanksgiving dinner 2011, at the lambic tasting in Monroe, the Stockholm lambic tasting 2013 ,and more recently at the Denver Ghost Tasting, this pour continues to illustrate why grape lambic embodies all that I desire in a beer. It really doesn’t get any better than this, having had nearly all the grape lambics and variants from Cantillon. Truly a special treat that defines a lambic lovers existence, the sweet forbidden Italian grape melded with the bright acidity of Cantillon lambic makes for a beverage not matched by any else on planet earth."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 10)",4.3,"375ml graciously shared by blatantdream. Thank you! Murky, dirty orange hue with plenty of handsome off-white foam adorning my glass. A gorgeous lambic. Dank grape aroma full of funk and hay. Grape drank, yâ€™all. Deep, complex fruit profile shows surprising resilience considering this bottle is now 6 years old. Puckering sourness massages my taste buds, imparting a pleasantly stinging brightness after each sip. So, this is a fantastic lambic, but itâ€™s not the end-all, be-all for me. I honestly prefer Foune to DQ, but damn am I glad to have tried this. Cheers!"

It pours a hazy red/deep pink colour with a small white head. Aroma is pure grape juice upfront with a funky feet and cheesy aroma. Some sweet candy notes too. Taste is acidic and sweet with grapes and candies upfront. Midway through the sip you get some mineral qualities, almost salty, then cheese and dust and quite a lot of funk. Dry sour finish. Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Overall, a big personal whale and a very good lambic too. It’s probably no better than a SanLam in absolute terms, but the DQ is truly unique."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 14)",4.9,"Bottle decanted and poured into a Cantillon tulip. Pour is a mildly hazy, juicy magenta. A finger of pink head. Smell is beautiful, rich grape and lemon acidity. A good dose of funk as well. Jammy grapes and lemon acidity on the taste. Grape flavor is rich, but not too sweet... balanced well with one of the cleanest funk profiles I’ve ever encountered. Minerally and delicious. Mouthfeel is rich, juicy, yet untterly drinkable. Dry finish. Overall... this might be tied with Blauw for the best beer I’ve ever had. Certainly the best fruited lambic. Perhaps we will meet again one day!"

As soon as you dig your nose into the glass your hit with the most beautiful, candy grape smelling flavor ever. On top of the grape dankness, there is a good bit of horseblanket, fruit skin, and barn. Flavor is concord grapes, acidic peach, vintage oak, blanket, and sour cherries. Dances on the tongue with a perfectly balanced body. This is honestly the best smelling and tasting lambic I have encountered. If you are lucky enough to try this lambic, make sure you have some Kleenex or a jizz rag with you. Cheers"
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 17)",4.6,"Bottle courtesy of Eric. Huge thanks to this beautiful beer. Pours a hazy murky reddish amber body with light white lacing. Aroma is candy grape flavor and nice funk. Mouthfeel is literally perfect - notes of grape candy haichu, grapes, funky fruit and sour tart candy. Super unique where the grape flavor dominates, but not at all in a bad way. Incredible."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 18)",4.9,"Bottle thanks to Ludvig.

Amazing beer grapes really goes beautiful in this beer it’s so good and you just want to drink this over and over again."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 19)",4.9,"One 750ml bottle, amazing taste of sweet candy mixed up with the cantillon sour lambic. the aroma reminds me of artificial candy, with some cantillon notes lifting it up. this is the best cantillon ive had so far, hoping to make a revisit to this willy wonkas candy land once again!"
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 20)",4.2,"Pours a cloudy orange-pinkish color with medium head. The nose is acid, lemon, funk, and a bit of red/black fruit. The palate is sour and dry with flavors of citrus, acidity, barnyard, a bit of grapes, and musty oak. Not a ton of grape flavor left but a nice Lambic overall."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 21)",4.7,"I’ve had this beer 5 or so times out of both 375ml & 750ml bottles. Original review 08-23-10 from 375ml bottle.



Pours a reddish/orange color, fizzy white head. Some lacing along the sides of the glass and a thin film on top as the cap. Grape juice, oak, funk/tart. I’m a huge fan of the Concord grape juice-esk smell. The funk melds wonderfully with the grapes and the oak notes are an added bonus. Solid. Grapes, tart/sour notes, slight oak, fruit characteristics, some must old barn in there as well. I am in lust with this beer. Light, champagne-esk lively carbonation, dry finish.



One of the best beers I’ve ever had, no doubt."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 22)",4.9,"Wow. The Don lives up to the hype. Nose is grape juice. Strongly reminiscent of concord grapes, some oak, hint of funk. Cloudy light red/dark pink. Taste is superb. Juicy grapes followed by light lemon tartness and a tpich of earthy funk. Refreshing - unlike any lambic I’ve had before. Fox grapes are legit."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 23)",3.7,"bottled, ericandersnavy tasting, clear orange in color with no head, few bubbles, aroma is dry white wine, musty, flavor is dry wine, light bodied, some sourness, funky yeast note, earthy floral finish"
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 24)",3.9,"Murky orange-red pour with a small white head. Nose is musty and very heavy on the grapes. Strong funk, lots of fruit, and plenty of acid. A touch of lemon zest, some blue cheese, and a bit of damp straw. Flavor is lightly sweet from the grapes, but still has a very pronounced acidity and sourness. Nice blue cheese funk, some grass, straw, and must. Strong citrus notes, a bit of oak, and a lot of barnyard funk."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 25)",4.6,"HUGE thanks to Umberto for busting out this rare treat during our epic drinking session at The Goblin Pub in Pavullo nel Frignano, Italy. Your generosity knows no limits! 

Pours a hazy, bright amber color with golden orange edges and a one finger frothy white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring. Sporadic streaks and spots of soapy lacing left behind. 

Sweet vinous aroma with a really strong grape presence countered by a decent amount of musty funk. Nice earthy barnyard character with some horseblanket, lactic funk, cobweb, oak and grape must. Subtle acetic presence but the sweet grape and vinous dark fruit notes keep it in check. Very inviting nose with the vinous fruit and musty funk complimenting each other perfectly. 

Tart and puckering with a good amount of sourness but it never becomes harsh or overly acidic. Lots of earthy barnyard funk and sweet, vinous fruit notes balance things out. Kind of reminds me of fresh St. Lamvinous but just a bit sweeter and more vinous. There’s a very prominent grape presence that counters the dry, musty funk and sour acidity nearly perfectly. Surprising how prominent the vinous fruit still is after four years. Some brett and lactic funk contribute to the complexity yet this beer remains delicate and easy to drink with some lingering acetic flavor in the finish that leaves me drooling for more. I could see this being too sweet and not sour enough for some people but I loved the balance of flavors."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 26)",4.4,"750 ml bottle generously shared by colonelforbin.  Huge thanks to Mike for sharing this rarity.  The Don pours cruddy reddish amber with a small white head that settles to a ring and leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass.    The musty, earthy grape juice.  Lots of grape juice, like Welch’s.  There is also an aroma that smells like smarties as well as a bit of a mineral note and very light sulfur.  The initial taste has a bit of sweetness with lots of musty grape juice.  It is fairly tart with lactic acid.  The smarties come through in the taste as well.  The finish is drying with more grape juice.  There as also a slight astringency.  Medium body.  Medium-low carbonation.  This beer is certainly unique and very good.  The Don lives up to the hype."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 27)",4.1,"Sampled March 2011; RBWG

The beer pours with a pale, wispy head that sits on top of a pale-purple tinged, amber colored beer. The nose has a really foxy (as in wild grape) note that sort of leans towards Concord grapes up front. There is a back note of mustiness, more moldy character, and some plastic-phenolic funkiness. It smells nicely tart, with more lactic notes than anything, but definitely some other acids round things out here as well. A butyric and goat-muskiness lightly touches the finish of the aroma.



As the beer first hits my mouth it tastes tart, but then gets more sharp and sour as it rolls across the tongue. This has a big, sharp, sourness in the end, but it is not acetic; some of the acidity must be from the grapes, as it is not entirely lactic in character. Linger flavors of foxy grapes melds with musky, and slightly moldy notes, as well as a touch of phenols that are almost plastic like in character. The plastic notes get a bit more prominent as the beer warms up. This is very dry, quite funky and the lemon-like tartness help immensely as well. A Brettanomyces signature plays a big role here, but part of the funkiness certainly comes from the particular grapes use. This is very light and quaffable (at least if you really like sours), but doesn’t come off as being watery or thin.



This is really nice, I would have loved to have had more, but this is certainly an awesome way to start off a grand tasting event. I like that this is super tart, and it is just so nicely evocative of musky, foxy, grapes and funk. This beer has definitely inspired me to find more funky, foxy, indigenous / wild grape varieties to use in Sour beers of my own; the signature that the grapes have left on this beer is just so interesting and intriguing."

Review #600

Vintage 2008
Bottle 64L

A: The appearance is radiant orange/red, akin to grape juice. The beer has a small head and leaves just a trace of lacing, typical of a Cantillon lambic.

S: The aroma is fantastic, with a balance of classic Cantillon funk and freshly squeezed grape juice.

T: Like the aroma, the flavor is grape juice and funk. The beer is not overly sour or funky, but I certainly would not describe it as sweet, even though grapes / grape juice are very prominent.

M: Medium thin bodied. The aftertaste is fantastic. The balance of funk and lambic flavors with fruit is wonderful.

D: A pleasure to drink. I could have sipped this all night, if only that were possible."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 29)",5,"Been waiting a long time for this day. My biggest personal whale for as long as I can remember. Pours a cloudy pinkish brownish red...kinda resembles a grapefruit in color actually. Small white head of tight, white bubbles. Nose is explosive fruit, specifically a mix of welch’s grapes and grapefruit. I don’t know where people were getting the shit/dirty diaper notes on this before, I think this smells amazing.  Doesn’t have as much of the Cantillon funk I expected. Flavor is incredibly tart, there is still a good amount of grape present, but I’ve been told its faded quite a bit since the last bottle the group had opened. There is some light lemon, but again, a lot less than a typical Cantillon offering. Light mouthfeel, good acidity, good carbonation, and a long finish. Such a great experience! I was skeptical that it wouldn’t hold up to the hype, but this beer is incredible. I think I need to follow through on getting one for the cellar. Thanks for going after this guy with me Ethan and Chris!"
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 30)",4.2,"From notes, had last year at Goblin.  Pours light red with a small pinkish off white head.  Nose is grapes, berries, light citrus, vinegar and funk.  Taste has notes of sweetness and bitter but sour dominates mostly.  Mouthfeel is soft and smooth.  body is light with a hug long lasting finish.  Great."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 31)",4.5,"reviewed 01-08-2012. never ever thought i would be doing this.... pour was a faint red with some violet. head was white and frothy with a hint of faint color like light red in it. some retention and lacing. pour was from towards the top so it was fairly clear and clean. scent was interesting. lots of cheese, old sweat, musty, with this light sharpness and intense concord grape. very complex and interesting. starts out quite sour and intense, then starts to fade out with a just amazing combination of subtle oak, mustiness, and straight grape in the finish. the grape just sits on the tongue. nice and dry with some help from the oak. nice mild carbonation, slight sweetness. this was amazing, lots of interesting characteristics all over it."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 32)",4,"Sampled at STLWill’s 30th b-day tasting. This was a beer where the nose and the taste were worlds apart for me.  Pours clear copper with a small white head.  The aroma has lots of unrefined wood, body odor, dirty grapes, light sourness and bugginess - this didn’t give me high hopes.  The body is light/medium as is smooth by the breweries standards along with mild carbonation.  The taste starts off with a husky/grainy quality that has a sweet/tart taste that’s very buggy and highly acidic.  The grapes didn’t come out to me until the finish and they came out big there with the Concord flavor.  Lots more acidity on the finish as well.   A great beer, just didn’t care for the aroma."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 33)",4.6,"750 ml bottle sampled at STLWill’s 30th birthday party- thanks, again! Pours a murky reddish gold color with a white ring for a head. Aroma has a big dose of red grapes, both tart and more sweet and juicy, with barnyard funk, oak, and cheese. Flavor of grapes, lemon juice, vinegar, oak, yogurt, and more farmhouse funk. Pretty damn sour and tart. Dry, with moderate carbonation. Pretty damn amazing."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 34)",4.9,"So very fortunate to try this one.  From notes, bottle share at CDC b4 release.  From such a small sample I got so much.  The palate was incredible, and followed a fruit forward but light nose, citrus, cherry, minimal funk.  Cascading down my palate was a hodgepodge of fruits and acidity.  Must have bottle."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 35)",4.6,"750ml bottle pours a hazy amber with a creamy, white head.  Nose is sweet, berries, earthy, wet fertilized soil, red grapes, funk, band aid, a little rotting vegetable, strawberry patch.  Flavor is more straight forward, grassy, hay, funky like the Blauw we had earlier but with white grapes, strawberry, berry sweetness, a little horsey, some bandaid.  Not as acetic as other Cantillons.  Perfect level of carbonation, soft, medium bodied, lightly tart.  Super smooth.  Very drinkable."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 36)",4.8,"Thanks Travlr and GT2! Hazy orange pour with pink hints. The aroma is pure bliss: ultra juicy grape skins and grape flesh with classic overbearing Cantillon acidity. So vibrant and juicy I can’t even believe it. Brett and farmy musty funk follow. The grapes completely dominate. Not overly nuanced or complex, but what we have here is certainly a masterpiece. Finish is dry and loaded with grapes."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 37)",4.8,"Bottle shared by GT2.  Pours lightly hazy copper/amber with a small, fizzy white head, short retention with good lacing.  Aroma is complex earthy, barnyard, and horse blanket with grapes, straw and meal malt, huge phenols and spicy hops.  Flavor is sour and tart grapes, spicy phenols, light Brettanomyces notes, oak, vinous, lactic sourness and a dry finish.  Medium-light body, no warmth, medium carbonation."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 38)",3.9,"fiery ruby grapefruit, thin white ring. Nose is light grape and strawberry, sweet fruit pulp grows with warmth, bit of stable in the back bit dusty, peppery. Pinot d’aunis has way more going on, laughable comparison though I had once thought it would be perfect side-side. Flavor is thinner, lightly sugary with white grape skins, very drying finish sourness lasting. No pepper or ultra dryness like Pinot daunis, grape skin appears sweet and thinner as a result, even softer body (how can anyone complain d’aunis dry tongue-rake is ""still"" compared to this?). Very nice, but as with most Cantillon, brett and acetic notes making it messy."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 39)",4.8,"Giant thanks to travlr and GT2 for sharing this epic bottle!! Beautiful pour with tints of pink, purple, and gumwood orange, along with a roseate head that dissipates quickly. Nose and flavor are absolutely rife with white grape and deep sweet concord grapes, light pepper, strawberry, and beautifully nuanced fruity funk. The flavor brings more strawberry, grape, and citric funk.  Honestly just an outrageously tasty fruit lambic. One of my favorite beers of all time."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 40)",3.9,"bottle.  poured a cloudy amberish type color with a white head.  aroma was grapes, horse blanket? and cherries.  flavor was grapes, cherry, funk, lemon, and orange.  body was light dry and fizzy."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 41)",4.1,"750mL thanks to Travlr. Given to me on my 24th birthday and shared at Sour Epic Part 2. Thank you Gene! The pour is quite hysterical- sort of a clear, neon purple with deep sunset highlights. A short lived pink head fizzes. Dregs at the end look opaque fuschia. Nose is at first a lot of white grape juice moving to sweet strawberry and tangy rhubarb. Very bright aroma and sweet grape juice and even hints of cinnamon and clove. Taste is straight geuze all the way with big tanginess, white pepper, mild berry character, and ruby red grapefruit sections and peel. Acidity level is perfect- juicy and tangy. Vibrant and bright. Perfect palate. Very yummy overall though I’m told the grape robustness is falling off and instead gaining more normal geuze complexity like older Blabaer batches."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 42)",3.8,"Nose is very phenolic, with lots of bandied. If you’re patient much of it blows off and you get some nice strawberry and melon. The taste is lightly sweet lots of fruit, fresh strawberry, light apricot. Light acetic acid on the finish."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 43)",4.3,Bottle shared by GT2: pours a clear deep orange with pinkish hues and a spotty-lacing white head. Has a fresh fruity grape nose with a healthy amount of barnyard character and vinous oak. Starts with fine carbonation and a touch of light fruity sweetness with complex grapeskin flavor and tart balance before a drier puckering finish.  Very unique and enjoyable brew.
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 44)",4.5,"Pours a pink tinted orange with a thin white head.  Very fruity aroma with notes of spice.  A touch of funky barnyard and bandaid.  Grapes and strawberries.

a - Pours a somewhat murky raspberry pink color with one inch of white head and moderate carbonation evident.

s - Smells of oak, welch grapes, tart fruit, funk, yeast, and a little manure. I like the smell and did not get as much manure as some people do, but it’s definitely the weakest part of the beer in my opinion.

t - Tastes of oak, grapes, tart apples, funk, tart fruit, and earthy notes.

m - Light body and low carbonation, awesome smooth body. Insanely easy to drink.

d - I thought this was an outstanding beer, aside from the smell. I just couldn’t get over the small manure in the smell to give this a better grade; without that this one would have been even better. Would love to have again and very glad I even got to try this one once."

Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 57)",4.3,"Opened by Thorpe429, thanks -- huge want of mine and a pretty good grape lambic. 

Beer is pinkish / purple and hazy with a thin diffuse head of tiny bubbles that don’t leave any lacing on the glass. Carbonation is moderate to low. Looks pretty good for a sour.

Aroma is fruity, like grapes with a sulfurish (not in a bad way) undertone and mild lactic sourness. I was expecting some more acetic, it was there but I’m not sure why I thought this would be vinegar. 

Beer is light in body and has a mild sweetness to it, its lactic and acetic sour with hints of citric acid as well. Its not too complex, not getting a lot of grass or hay but there is a mild oakiness to it but without the vanilla, more the funk. Its nice and easy to drink. I think I like Lamvinous better but this is a good beer and I would definitely drink it again.

Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 60)",4.8,"HUGE thanks to Sean for this. Shared with Sean, Mike, and Alex on an awesome Sunday afternoon...375ml bottle into a Lost Abbey glass...Pours a light and bubly purple, kind of dark out but nothing special...The aroma is the best sour ever. It has the smoothest but deepest funk ever, almost manure like but in an appealing way. The first funk that actually really brings me back to the smell of visting my grandparents ranch in Texas. What makes this aroms even better is that its balanced nice with sweet smell of grapes a perfect combo to break up the depths of the funk...The taste thankfully picks up for the most part where the aroma left out. Funk is there but now the grapes come through more, a touch to much of the grapes. 

This is a top beer by far and must get for all Cantillon lovers, no matter the cost. I’d love to have this again side by side with blabaer just to see which of these is truly not only the best Cantillon but best sour in the world. Yeah, its that good.

All prior brews were so jaw-locking that I didn’t really enjoy them.  This one has made me reconsider and has opened my eyes to what this brewery can do.  Popped the cork on this one and immediately noticed the fragrant aroma.  I was awe-struck...this is the best smelling sour I have ever had the pleasure of inhaling.  Incredible grape, tart cherry skin, lemon pith, and balsamic vinegar make their way to the nose.  Extremely bright fruit presence, minimal funk in the aroma.  Visually, this one was watermelon in color with a nice wispy white head.  Solid carbonation.  Beautiful.  Flavor is vastly different that the aroma (and reading the ratings, it appears that everyone’s perception was skewed based on where in the bottle you got a sample).  Tons of funk, horse blanket, and lemon Jolly Rancher accompany raspberry, grape, and wild cherry. Extremely acidic.  Could drink this all day, every day.  Truly incredible!!!  BUMP!!!"

Pours a cloudy bright red/pink hue with a medium white head. Lots of carbonation. The strangest nose ever; huge rotting decayed fruit, almost no normal person would smell this beer and think it was nice, it’s a funky rotting smell that dominated some nice woody fruit. The flavor though is much different; quite tart, but a burst of sweet fruit, grapes for sure, but there is sweeter fruit suggested, sour and woody, quite sour at points, nearing quite acidic. Certainly dry and very nice. So unusual it’s hard to measure it against anything else."

A: Slightly hazy orange-red with perhaps a slightly purplish hue. Small, but tightly-packed bubble-filled head. Spotty lacing.



S: Unique grape aroma. Best way to describe it is that wonderful Welches grape jelly aroma. Light acidic citrus undercurrents. A little oak and must. Some miscellaneous berries as well that are a little tough to identify with all that grape jelly.



T: Damn. I love this. Its like Blabaer in the sense that the uniqueness of the flavor is pretty close to mind-blowing. Like the nose tons of grape jelly, raspberries, lemon, wood, must, funk. 



M: A slight sweetness up front followed by a drying finish. Medium to light bodied. Even effervescence. Not overly sour and puckering, but there is plenty of acidity there to keep a sour-head happy.



O: A truly unique Cantillon offering. Certainly one of my favorites. The only question is... what the hell do I do with my last bottle... drink or cellar?"
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 73)",4.2,"Huge thanks to Alle & Livingstone. Beautiful dark pink little hazy with no head. Aroma is very strong of grapes, and in particular of peels. Lovely funkiness underneath. The sourness is balanced and the fruitiness is perceivable. Drying effect. Delicious."

Delightful and very well balanced. thx. yespr for sharing"
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 79)",4.4,"Very excited to be able to try this one. 375mL bottle.

Pours a bit lighter than cranberry juice. Maybe a slight golden tint, but not much--this is pretty much all red. Absolutely gorgeous color. Nice thin white head and some lacing as it goes down. Nose brings forth plenty of sour grapes along with some Brett and a bit of sourness. Also some hay and oak in there. The flavor really accentuates the grapes, and leaves the funk and the sourness in the background. I really like where it ended up. Mouthfeel is nice, as the interplay between the fruit flavors and the funky sourness are really carried by the carbonation. Drinkability is really quite great, as this finds a very nice balance between fruit, funk, and sour.

Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 80)",4.5,"Bottle shared by callmemickey at Alan’s tasting. Pours red apple with white head. Nose of berry funk, tart fruits and yeast. Taste is lots of berry funk, tart fruit, yeast and earthy grapes. World class."

Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 82)",4.4,"750mL bottle shared by my cousin Greg a few months ago. Bottle #043. 
Pours reddish orange, topped with a thin off-white head. Nice red grape aroma. There are notes of grape juice and perhaps cranberry as well. Aroma is only moderately lactic. Red grape and grape juice are the predominant flavors, with complexity added by a moderate amount of lactic acid and notes of earth, raspberry and plum. A hint of tropical fruit, especially pineapple, comes forth towards the finish. Acidity lingers along with some grape. Well balanced carbonation makes this very easy to drink. It was a pleasure to try this, and I think it will improve with a year in the cellar."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 83)",4.3,"[Bottle] shared by Randall. Thanks! Pours a peachy orange with an effervescent pinkish head. Aroma is bright and crisp, moderate barnyard brett, nice light grapiness, quite lactic with little acetic acid. Flavor is super tart and crisp, light grapes, typical Cantillon barnyard funky brett, tons of lactic acid. It tastes young still, super bright, clean, and I’m not really sure what age will do to this one."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 84)",4.1,"750ml bottle # 58LRich Aroma is both sweet and tart. The classic Cantillon funk paired with a delicate, but not overpowering fruitiness. Plenty of floral aspects as well: lavender, jasmine, roses. Lighter grape skin tannin, some plums and a good dose of drying oak. I really enjoy how the funk/flowers/fruit interact with each other. The nose on this is absolutely stunning. Pours a very attractive cloudy peachy/rose color with a thin, but tight bright white head. Flavor is vibrant, fresh and perhaps a little young. Nice interplay of grape tannin, oak tannin and wild yeast. Fairly dry. Little to no sweetness. The grapes add a nice, tannic flavor. A bit of must and cobwebs.  Fairly clean all across the tongue with a biting, gripping acidic finish down the throat. Medium bodied, excellent carbonation with a vibrant, clean finish. Thanks Randall!"
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 85)",4.4,"750 bomber, had with friends at our epic sour tasting at Jasons. Pours a hazy orange with a fluffy white head. Deep aroma of fruits - lemons, pineapple, strawberries and tell-tale funk. Nicely carbonated, lightly sour. Didn’t get the Welches grape as much as light cherry / strawberry flavors.  Nice body and good legs on the finish. Wonderfully balanced. Thanks to Franco for sending this memorable brew to me to share."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 86)",4.3,"Big concord grape aroma.  Quite tart and dry (as if one would expect anything else from Cantillon!).  Not ultra complex, but significantly more elegant than any grape wine I have ever had from Lambrusca grapes."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 87)",4.6,"Bottle. Pours a amber red color with a white collared head. Very purple grape smellig like concord grapes. Barnyard as well. The aroma has a slight aroma of horse apple aka barnyard manure, this aroma seems to be quite polarizing, either you like it or hate it. The taste is leaps and bounds better than the aroma and I like the aroma! Flavorwise I get purple grape first and foremost followed by some earthiness and oakiness. The taste is really good, wow. Don Q is the man. Sour and tart that makes you pucker. Light mouthfeel with nice balance of carbonation. Overall, a really nice beer and one that I will probably never get the chance to try again."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 88)",4.3,"Bottle shared with Travlr and Livingstone: Poured a reddish ruby with pink tints, hazy white head. The aroma is sour grapes, fruit, nice funkiness.

Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 89)",4.4,"LCBS 2010.  Purplish/pinkish pour.  Aroma is quickly dominated by grapes.  Concord grapes and strawberries.  Flavor has some of the normal Cantillon funk, wood to go along with the grape flavor.  I liked this, I am not sure this will age and I am not sure that pure sour heads will be all that enthused."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 90)",4.2,Thank you Greg for sharing this bottle at the LCBS 10.  WoW!!!  The beer poured ruby red with a small pink head.  The aroma was grape and carbonation.  The taste was fantastic with grape flavors headlining the bill.  Providing the backbeat were tart citrus and straw notes.....  Amazing.......
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 91)",4.6,"Aroma is like liquid concord grapes; lots of grape skin, very bright fruit, lactic sourness, funk, and residual sugar.

Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 93)",4.4,"Cantillon don quijote. 375ml body. Big thanks to Sean.... Pours a  
deeper reddish caramel brown with a thin soapy white head... Aroma is  
a huge barnyard stankonia which I have grown and love. A bunch of  
filfthy dirtiness meshed perfectly with the concord grape coming  
midway through and sustained beyond the finish... Flavors are funky with a big farmhouse cheezy
presence. Much less
diry farmhouse funk than the aroma which allows for great drinkability.. Grapes comes through in the finish which  
allows for all of its aspects to come together from a synergy perspective. Nice  
adequately bodied with perfect acidity...
Almost preferred the nose to the flavor overall. All around excellence. Must get another sample of this somehow!

Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 94)",4,"Rating #2100!!!  The tick train keeps rolling on.  750ml bottle shared by MasterSki on BA.

The color is hazy reddish-copper and the white head leaves a thick white ring on the glass.  Good lacing.

The aroma is interesting - red grapes, funk, earth, and cobwebs.

The flavor has a lot in common with Welch’s grape juice, but in a very good way. Concord grape, goat blanket, and typical Cantillon funk.

Nice palate - medium acidity with medium body and somewhat lively carbonation.

Very good fruit lambic overall.  Justifies the hype for the most part."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 95)",3.6,"750ml bottle courtesy of Masterski.



Funny things, these Italian grapes. They’re similar to Concord grapes, which are what Welch’s uses for their eponymous grape juice. And I could not get that out of my head.



Though I did try: Don Quijote looks different, being copper colored and carbonated. And it smells.. uh.. kind of different, like leather, pepper, geosmin, and gravel. And Welch’s grape juice. Wave upon wave of that musky grape fluid.



The taste is mostly juice, underwritten by Cantillon’s signature sweaty fetlock, yellow woodsorrel, and oak barrel. Some residual sweetness coats the mouth.



A nice effort, especially if you’re a fan of Welch’s. Some age would do it good."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 96)",4.5,"375ml bottle pours a cloudy orangish red with a small beige head. Smells of wonderful fruits with a nice hit of funk. Amazingly smooth, much more so than any other Cantillon I have had to date. .Tastes of strawberries and a slight hint of grape but strawberries is the forfront flavor with a slight acidity to follow. Wonderful beer for sure, and will probably only get better with age."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 97)",4.8,"37.5 ml bottle courtesy of Franco, shared with SHIG on Oct 16, 2010.  Special thanks to Franco for sharing this one, and for spending a wonderful afternoon with us!  Pours slightly hazy orange, medium white head.  Aroma of strawberries, pineapple, slight raspberries, dust.  Taste is acidic, very fruity with strawberries dominating.  Good character and complexity already, but I can’t wait to see what happen to this one over time - it has great potential.  I hope he and Umberto brew it again next year! 9-4-9-4-18.
Next rating, 750 ml bottle shared with ajax25g on November 6, 2013. Poirs cloudy rose red color, thin pink head. Aroma is amazing, with attic dust and basement funk, with bright fruit in the background. Taste is softly sour cherries, strawberries, lemon. Dry finish. Amazing. 
Next taste, bottle shared with Franco in the opening moments of 2018.  The fruitiest I have ever had, perfectly preserved over the years.  Continues to impress."
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 98)",4.5,"Huge thanks to livingstone for that 37,5cl bottle. Looks really, really good, old-styled, creative name. Beer in the glass copper-brownish, small head. Moldy-old aroma. Starts intense sourish-fruity, lemon notes, also very light sweet notes in the background. Increasing fruityness, for a moment it reminds me of a good dry wine. Finish wonderful balanced, prickly. Long lasting finish. Very drinkable. I wish I had more of this and could drink a bottle every day!"
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 99)",4.2,"Faintly pink, thinning head, fed by lively carbonated hazy orange-flamingo beer. Intense aroma of red fruit & rosehips, with a slight taint of rotting - close to noble rot, but also to ""’t putteke"". Tart, dry, raspberry-like flavour, but way more delicate, wild (red) fruit or quetches, again this noble rot - or truffles - flavour peeking through. High acidity level, not for the fainthearted! Dry-out effect, puckeringly sour, very refreshing, some slickness, near filmy, at the back of the tongue. Aftertaste has totally exotic fruit (or blueberries!), something vinous and a jumble of acids. Absolutely unique - and hence  un TRES grand merci à Glougloupdany pour ce merveilleux souvenir de voyage!"
Cantillon Don Quijote,"(1, 100)",4.3,"In short: A surprisingly refreshing and easy to drink complex fruit lambic.

How: Bottle 750ml.  Shared with my Florence buddy, Andrea.  You’re the man Andrea!!!

The look: Cloudy dark orange-red body topped by short lived beige head

In long: Nose is medium funky with a nice rich fruity character.  Taste is smoother than most Cantillon I’ve had.  The fruits take a lot of room in this beer.  It is brewed with grapes but grapes is the not the fruit I would have named first.  The taste has a lot of tropical fruits (pineapples, mandarins, grapes, etc.) and also strawberries and the likes.  The sourness and acidity level is medium (which means low for a Cantillon) and the beer is surprisingly easy to drink by big sips, something I rarely do with a Cantillon.  The beer is excellent but still very fresh.  As it is right now it is an average Cantillon, I’ll open another bottle in a few years and I’m expecting great things.  The fruit character of this beer is awesome, it just needs to develop more acidity and dryness, something that most Cantillons develop with age.  Named after the most famous opponent to green renewable energy technology."

MBCC2017 Backlog. Pours a dark ruby/purple with no head or carbonation. This is in a lot of ways similar to it's regular version but manages to pack in even more tastes. It still has that intense, fruit jam concentrate berry presence of raspberry, blueberry, blackberry. In this version it's a bit more subdued though. Less fruit sweetness and more of a deep rich caramel, fudge, vanilla input from the barrel. Tartness has stepped aside for more tannic oak qualities. The barrel gives this lovely complexity that has an almost earthy note to it yet is unremarkably present in it's sweetness. This is so unbelievably tasty, could sip on it forever."

Aroma is surprisingly earthy, indeed the pour at Hatten had an odd potting soil vibe, heavy jammy berry mix, chocolate, oak, light toast, vanilla, rich. Flavour loses some of the overt earth, lots of rich jammy mixed berries again, perhaps raspberry/blackberry pop out most, chocolate, deep honey, vanilla, oak, lightly toasty, slightly tannic in the back end. Full bodied, oily to syrupy, bare touch of alcohol. Lovely, perhaps loses out to the strawberry of the normal variants but on its own merits it's totally sublime. Nice barrel work."

Cigar City Pilot Series Miami Madness,"(1, 5)",4.1,"draft at Hunahpu... bright dark orange, a bit cloudy, big white head... tropical fruit aroma, guava, mango, acid, super easy to drink on a hot day"
Cigar City Pilot Series Miami Madness,"(1, 6)",4.7,"Pours a bright yellowish orange, a bit thick and pulpy.  Aroma is very very tropical, a mishmash of fresh juices.  Flavor is divine.  Loads of mango and guava with some light pineapple.  Very juice like until a puckering acidic blast hits you.  Wonderful stuff, the perfect Florida beverage."
Cigar City Pilot Series Miami Madness,"(1, 7)",4.5,"Draft at Cigar City during Hunahpu Day 2012. 

Pours a cloudy, bright golden yellow color with a one finger frothy white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring. Sporadic spots of lace left behind. 

The aroma of this beer is pretty remarkable. It’s just bursting with fresh tropical fruit notes while being countered by lactic funk, bready yeast and citrus. Lots of mango, papaya, pineapple and other tropical fruits but it still smells like a Berliner. A decent amount of earthy funk, wheat/bread and a touch of citrus balance things out.

Medium bodied with an explosion of tropical fruit notes that linger over subtle funk and acidity into a dry finish. Similarly to the aroma, there is a ton of amazing tropical fruit flavor but it still has the qualities of a berlinerweisse. A bit sweet perhaps but there is still some wheat/bready yeast flavor along with subtle acidity and lactic funk countering the fruit notes. Refreshing and delicious."
Cigar City Pilot Series Miami Madness,"(1, 8)",4.7,"Hand bottle from my main man Dave. Pours a light cloudy yellow, resembles a mimosa or piña colada actually. The nose is perfection, holy shit! Tropical fruit explosion, banana, mango, and pineapple. I’ve never smelt anything like this in my life, sO unique. Flavor continues the epicness of this beer. The fruit just pops so well, it’s a perfect balance of tart and fruit. Puckeringly tart, good carbonation, and a great finish. One of the best beers I’ve ever had, it was such a unique experience. The tropical fruit blast was unlike anything I’ve ever had in a beer. Can’t wait to try more of Wakefield’s stuff."
Cigar City Pilot Series Miami Madness,"(1, 9)",4.6,"Draft… CCB’s Hunahpu’s Day 2012… This beer rocks!… Murky light-yellow ale with a small, creamy, white head. Good retention. The aroma supplies loads of tropical fruitiness and acidity – pineapple, passionfruit, lemon and a hint of mango. Medium-bodied and ultra-creamy with feather-soft carbonation. The flavor is crazy fruity and involuntary-eye-squintingly sour, providing plenty of passionfruit, mango and pineapple greatness. Finishes crisp, silly tart and clean. Another world class sour fruit beer brewed by Johnathan Wakefield on CCB’s pilot system!"
Cigar City Pilot Series Miami Madness,"(1, 10)",4.4,"On-tap at Hunahpu’s Day 2012.

A - Pours a bright yellow color, white fizzy head, thin collar.

S - A tropical explosion, to say the least. The sour/tart notes aren’t quite as strong as the Passionfruit/Dragonfruit, which is nice. Citrus, mango, pineapple, mandarin oranges. So refreshing.

T - I would drink this beer every morning with my breakfast, if I could. Huge tropical sweetness, so fresh...just like the fruits from the market and put into my drink. The tartness is really nice and subtle, which makes this chuggable. Finish is light tartness and fruits.

M - Light, uber-refreshing, good carbonation, dry tart finish.

O - An excellent berliner, to say the least. This beer was just super crushable and was like drinking a fruity refreshing beach cocktail. Right up there with the Passionfruit Dragonfruit, IMO. Superb."
Cigar City Pilot Series Miami Madness,"(1, 11)",4.4,"Mango passion Berliner, aka Miami had a few samples at Hunahpus Day 2012... Intense tropical fruit with mango and  
passionfruit, vivid and bright with a very active sour quality...  
Flavors follow suit to a tee and follows through a bit more juicy  
fruit with an ideal sense if sour quality. Easy drinking with lighter  
than medium bodied. Delightful.

Cigar City Pilot Series Miami Madness,"(1, 12)",5,"Holy crap somebody get a tap line of this and hook it up at my house. Pours a orangish yellow. BOOM this think has so much tropical fruit in the nose it is ridiculous, guava, bananas, citrus, passionfruit, mangoes. Like a dang tropical fruit market in a glass, and that is just how it tastes. The carbonation is spot on and the body is medium but well balanced against everything else. Super winner here."
Cigar City Pilot Series Miami Madness,"(1, 13)",4.5,"On draft at Hunahpu Day 2012.  Pours the color of grapefruit juice with a white head.  Nose is some light malt, tart citrus along with definite guava and airs of mango and passion fruit.  Flavor is similar to the Royal Rumble of tartness that is the other JW berliners, but this one has guava throughout to nurse the mouth through the mammoth tartness.  Medium in body for a berliner and simply outstanding overall."
Cigar City Pilot Series Miami Madness,"(1, 14)",5,"On draft at Cigar City Huna Day 2012. OK I thought that Cookies & Milk was the best beer of  the day until I tried this. Absolutely incredible! If I could get this on a regular basis I would  stock up, big time. Everything is just spot on, the sour funk, aroma, flavor, everything."
Cigar City Pilot Series Miami Madness,"(1, 15)",5,"Oh my god.  I could drink this by the gallon.  Pours a cloudy dark yellowish color, white head.  Aroma is just loaded with tart and tropical fruits.  I get lots of guava up front finishing with passionfruit and mango.  Flavor is so juicy, enticingly sour, but so drinkable. So perfectly balanced.  WOW.  You did it again my friend.  BRAVO!"
Cigar City Pilot Series Miami Madness,"(1, 16)",4.2,"Poured a cloudy straw yellow with some orange highlights.  Aromas of tart citrus acid, guava, and some mango.  Flavors of not overpowering tart tropical fruits, with some grain flavor peaking its head out.  Again another outstanding Berliner that was great in the heat."
Cigar City Pilot Series Miami Madness,"(1, 17)",4.5,"On tap at Hunahpu’s Day.  Cloudy pale yellow pour with a frothy white head.  Exotic fruit aromas.  Phenomenal!!  Tart and refreshing with all kinds of acidic citrusy elements.  Light in body with papaya, guava, and mango highlights.  Seriously, this is the second year in a row that JW’s berliner weisses have stolen the show!!!!"
Cigar City Pilot Series Miami Madness,"(1, 18)",4.7,Another one that went quickly on Hunahpu day. This was my favorite berliner. A fantastic aroma to start and the flavor finished with a great balance of what I could only think of as pineapple meat (as you get closer to the core). A stunner. Sourness and acidity were spot on.
Cigar City Pilot Series Miami Madness,"(1, 19)",4.2,"This fantastic brew looked like watered down orange juice and had some lacing. Aromas were full of papaya, banana and guavas. The taste was full of sour tropical fruits that balanced out with a bright and holly finish. It would be a pleasure to drink too much of it."
Cigar City Pilot Series Miami Madness,"(1, 20)",4.2,"Tap at Hunahpu day 2012. I’m not much of a sour guy but any beer J. Wakefield touches seems to be frickin awesome. This one had a real fruity, guava-esque aroma to it. Acidic citrus and tropical fruits explode on the nose. Woah. Body wise, this one was a hazy light orange color. The initial taste makes you pucker up a bit but not too much. The tropical fruits really come out with a grainy background that make this one pretty well balanced. Tart but not overly so. Great!"
Cigar City Pilot Series Miami Madness,"(1, 21)",4.3,"On tap at CCB for Hunahpu’s Day 2012. Pours cloudy orangeish appearance. Aroma is like one of those cheap cans of frozen orange juice you can get from Wal-Mart... but in a good way. Very tart, but the fruit starts to balance out the sour and there is a nice wheaty background that makes this extremely balanced. Very, Very, Very good sour."

Sahtipaja MeadMe Batch #2 - Bourbon Vanilla,"(1, 3)",4.7,"Bottle from Jacob, thanks a ton!! Pours still into a brandy snifter. Dark red, with purple and copper hues. Aromas are of sweet honey, light caramelization, currant, cherry are huge, oak and vanilla in the background. Taste is a sweet harmony of a honey backbone, with brown sugar, caramel, maple notes creping in. The fruit here is prominent but never cloying or too jammy. Incredible balance between the currant and cherry. Gooseberry in the background with some tang. Bourbon, oak, and vanilla are all subtle, but present. Warming alcohol in my chest, but never on my palate. Such an incredible beverage. Cheers!"

Full, smooth mouthfeel, slight tart finish. The vanilla is evident, a bit too much for me in the nose, and a not quite enough in taste and aftertaste where is is overshadowed by raisins. I liked the original batch 2 with no vanilla a tad more, this feels like the alcohol and the tartness comes through more, making it a tad less drinkable and not as smooth. Still a very nice mead!"

Reminded me very much of a dessert wine, as it also had that slight Botrytis honey edge on the finish, alongside the sweet stewed apple. Summed up in two words – sticky, and sweet. Very nice apple flavour though, no question. Like drinking apple honey [22042012]"

Aroma is freshly cut apple slices, apple sauce with cinnamon, light funk and earthy tones. Mouthfeel is syrupy and rich with notes of honey, apples, cinnamon, earthy spices, light funk, apple sauce and apple juice. Probably the best Ice Cider I’ve had the pleasure of trying thus far."

First tried this as Frimas from Joe McPhee at the RBSG 2010 Grand Tasting. It was so damn good in my tiny sample that I had to go and get a bottle via trade with cfrancis.



Poured out a lovely gold elixir that slid out of the bottle. Wide, slow sexy legs melt back into the silky concoction. The aroma is freaking succulent and drool inducing. Endless apples, none with a sour hint, deep sweetness that amazes, the faintest of alcohol, pure heaven - I do not know what else to say about the aroma - it is not complex aside from the depth of the apple goodness - simple wonderful. The taste is unreal. Satisfying to no end. Sweet apple fruit, thick sugar goodness, hint of alcohol and a tart bite that comes in near the end and then sneaks away until the next sip. Very rich and maybe a wood character but I’m only half convinced at that claim. Ooozes across my palate and sticks to everything leaving a velvety coating that can be worn down by sucking - and even that is something to look forward to. This is an impeccable delight."
La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"(2, 10)",4.3,"Sampled from the bottle. Pours a clear deep gold with no head whatsoever. Aroma was full of extremely fresh apples, both tart and sweet with a bit of a backing sweet fruit note. Flavor began with sweet apples but was balanced very nicely by tart apples as well as a slight note of baked apples in the finish. Great on the tongue."
La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"(2, 11)",4.4,"Shared at rbsg by ClarkW. Tepid honey amber pour. Nose is apple, honey, very sweet but depth in the richness. Flavor is apple, apple skin, light wood, and a gritty sugary thickness that sets it aside from my memory of other la face ciders. I’m reminded of the Kill Bill quote: ""When you compare a hattori hanzo sword, you compare it to every other sword... every other sword that wasn’t made by hattori hanzo."""

The pour is a golden, thick nectar with insane legs all over the glass. Nose is crisp and fresh apple explosion with ambrosia, coconut, pineapple. Just an unreal onslaught of fresh red and yellow apples. Taste is soft, baked apple pie with cinnamon, golden pears, lime honey, and vanilla ice cream. Wickedly soft palate. So good that you may start crying. My girlfriend after taking one sip said, ""I think I just found Jesus."" Probably the best thing you will ever drink in your life."

Pours a clear yellow, aroma is essentially distilled and concentrated apples, not too sweet, not too sour, just perfect balance of apples with a nice tang. Great feel on the palate but hard to describe overall - perhaps because its very unlike any beers I’ve had and I have very little experience with ciders. But overall this was amazing and I highly recommend spending the money to try this - but it needs to be shared since its like a dessert wine - small glasses."

This ice ciders are just amazing, but they are not super complex and don’t need to be. In the middle of a intense tasting a taste of this wakes up you palate in a glorious way.

Last time I was in Montreal I couldn’t bring myself to shell out for a bottle, but after tasting it this time I bought one immediately.  Definitely worth it."

Tasted at Face Cachee.  Deep burnished golden pour.  Thick legs stream down the side of the glass.  Intense sweet nose with a bit, bright pineapple and lemon acidity.  Heavy spiced stewed apple aroma along with a touch of caramelized flavour.  Incredibly concentrated flavour with a bright sugary character in addition to the heavy fruitiness.

A zesty grapefruit-like presence can also be found, which is a quality totally absent from the cidery’s other offerings.  Thich and incredibly rich.  Concentrated apple sugars in a blissful package.

Spice a plenty, sweet as hell and loads of fruit. Those apples are just amazing. Amazing toffee notes in the flavour. Ok you piss taking set of bastards (Tom & Sim) I mean candy apple. Lashings of custard. This is, as Tom describes, like apple pie and custard without the pastry. Big tarty apple bite with plenty of sharp acidty that rather than lingering in the background is brought rushing to the front carried by the alcohol. Darker than the Neige and like a bigger badder brother. A bloody amazing experience that brings back all the fantasticness of last time I tried this stunning nectar."
La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"(2, 63)",4.6,"Many thanks to Glouglouburp for this amazing bottle. Unlike anything I have ever had before. Aroma is mainly apples, but the taste was much more complex. There was an upfront taste of blue cheese followed by sweet apples, and apricot. Truely amazing. I would like to get more of this unique cider from Quebec."
La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"(2, 64)",4.3,"375ml. bottle thanks a million to Glouglouburp. Crystal clear golden orange color, obviously still, with nice legs. Beautiful aroma of baked apples, especially the skins, with a hint of cinnamon and honey. Flavor was sweet apples, honey, floral notes and a mild warming alcohol finish. Not as pure an apple flavor as the Neige, but a bit more complex and not as sweet. Delicious! Thanks Dany!"

La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"(2, 66)",4.2,"375mL bottle, courtesy of radiomgb.  Thanks, Jeff!  Pours a brilliant, oily honey-orange color; headless; so oily it barely grows legs at first; then, thick.  Apples you can smell from across the room: slightly tart, fresh apples, a bit of funk and mustiness; nothing overly sticky, though definitely sweet; very well-hidden alcohol; apples, apples, apples.  Full mouthfeel: impressively dense and warming; oily, fresh apple character; not juice, not sweetened, just dense, intricate pressed iced apples.  Lengthy finish, showing tons of apples (surprise!), residual sugar, and some light tartness; ends without stickiness.  Beautifully done."

Huge, rich, resinous, sweet apple flavor - sugary, a little boozy but not too much, tangy, peppery red apples and a light touch of white grapes.  Really, really delicious."
La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"(2, 68)",4.3,"375ml split on Valentines Day. I’m not as crazy about this as I have been with past samples. Perhaps it’s now that I have so much of it, or that I’m drinking so much more. The sweetness becomes a bit cloying after a while, and the alcohol presence is strong. It is still delicious, with a supernaturally thick body, delicious apple and grape sugar. There is a touch of acidity early in the sip, with a bit of cookie and cake later. Apples taste is very young, green, not the old, rich apple I’ve noticed in Neige and other frozen-juice ice ciders. I couldn’t possibly deny the greatness of this beverage, but truth to be told, it’s not one meant for even moderately large quantities of drinking."
La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"(2, 69)",4.2,"Bottle. Vintage 2002: 3962/5000. Pours a still, gradient orange body with some nice viscous legs.

The tartness wafts towards your eyes but becomes counterbalanced with some fruity, almost banana-sweetness and alcohol. Lingering apple finish.
Excellent."

La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"(2, 75)",4.6,"Courtesy TheCheeseMan.  Huge thanks for sharing this rare and expensive little gem. The still body is a thick, viscous, golden-orange honey color.  The aroma is that of pure apple essence, as condensed and concentrated as can possibly be.  It can only be described as the freshest apple juice you have ever encountered, painstakingly reduced to the nth degree.  The flavor is inconceivably perfect, like a million fresh apples that have been crushed in the dead of winter, in the middle of the unadulterated wilderness, and somehow crammed into a tiny package.  A thick, oily body glides over the tongue, effortlessly delivering the sweet apple goodness to each and every corner of the mouth.  Finishes long and sweet, with the absolutely perfect amount of alcoholic heat. This represents the absolute pinnacle of the ice cider classification, and perhaps the dessert beverage genre as a whole.  Simply outstanding!"

La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"(2, 77)",4.5,"In short: THE mother of all (ice) ciders.

How: Many times.  Lately I had the three Face Cachée de la Pomme classics (Neige, Neige Éternelle and Frimas) side by side at Montreal’s Flaveurs, Bières and Caprice Festival 2007.

The look: Stale orange body with no head

In long: The most easily drinkable (dangerously drinkable) of the Face Cachée lineup.  Flavour is concentrated apple juice (as opposed to the apple skins taste of the Neige) and adds touches of apricot.  A bit more syrupy than the others with more of an marmalade/applesauce flavour.  Amazing full and smooth mouthfeel.  Wonderful stuff.  But $50/375ml, ouch!  Oh man one day I’d like to get hammered on that stuff.  Some say I have a drinking problem.  Yes I do, I can’t afford it."

I was trying to trade for this, but didn’t have big enough guns (needed BA Alesmith+$50 beer).  I think Chris bought this 1993 version for $30 a few years ago.  Aroma is concentrated apples.

Again, lots of delicious sweet apples along with some other fruit, sweet honey, some oak, alcohol (it’s there but it’s subtle), spices (nutmeg and more) and a good amount of acidity

There is some mild tartness and sweet citrus fruits galore.  Really fresh smelling for being so old.  Smells like an orchard with some honey mixed in.  The flavor is quite powerful.  Really rich and full bodied the whole way through.  The palate is coated nicely.  The apples, as expected, are quite profound, but get some semblance of balalnce by the honey characters in this.  Really warming on the waydown.  Pretty sweet, but not overly so.  Great dessert drink.  Enjoyed this immensly."

La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver,"(2, 95)",4.5,"Melted bricks of gold covered in oils and sunburst orange candy shells. Totally translucent, wide and shapely legs. The aroma is pulsing with apple, whole and stem-inclusive, so potent it’s hard to move the cider glass away from my nose to attempt a sip. The nose is not eve close to wholly apple, however. Apricot, puree, high-brix honey, molasses, maple, fresh figs, black cherry pit notes in moderation, mild spiciness, white flowers undefined, vanilla, the mildest lavender essence, clove liqueur all hold my attention as long as they please. This aroma is pure, it is dew-scented, it is utterly magnificent. In the flavor, at first, medium-high acidity seems out of place and overdrawn. Sweetness is very high but it’s not as intense as expected, actually less than the Neige ice cider from the same ciderie, mostly due to relatively high acidity. Bold tropical fruit notes now include pineapple and mango, as well as lesser kiwi. Notes of woodgrain trickle in and back out again. The finish is smooth, sweet, lightly acidic, enduring and succulent. The mouthfeel is extremely full bodied, viscous, sticky, syrupy and sugary. Alcohol is incredibly well concealed throughout this entire experience. A masterpiece."

Hints of Keifer lime leaves finish the assault.  The flavor is an intensity the likes of which I have never experienced.  Concentrated apple essence, hints of apricots and slight notes of tropical fruits.  There is an acidity that pulls everything together.  As close to perfection as I think I will ever see.

Superstition Berry White,"(1, 36)",4.3,"Berry white tasting. Bottle 1. Thanks to svartvit for organisizing. Clear deep dark red. Massive tooth crushing sweet raspberries and honey, some suggestion of blackcurrant, blackberries. Super sweet to a point it turns sour around the edges, after which some toasted marshmallow crust and raspberry meringue shows it’s face, to be washed away again in dens fruity sweetness. In the deeper earthy notes I get some of that roasted paprika aroma I often get in red fruited meads. In the meantime the elamel of my teeth screams in horror. Very nice, but a bit too screamy sweet."
Superstition Berry White,"(1, 37)",4.4,"Bottle shared at Berry White tasting. Clear deep dark red with no head. Massive cassis jam, dry raspberries, soft vanilla, honey, black currants, blackberries. Very fruity, with a light vanilla pastry note, a bit of honey, dry berry skins. Quite sweet and light sour and bitter. Thick full bodied. Very good!"

Full sweet flavour with lots of jammy berries, still some dryness, mild alcohol, seedy raspberry preserve, cherry, blackberry. Full bodied, lightly chewy.

Flavour is quite sweet but with a prominent tart edge, raspberry jam, tingling cranberry, sweet honey, touches of white chocolate and vanilla, slight earth, long sweet-tart finish.

Intense red berry nose (not sure I'd say raspberry if trying it blind), vanilla pale honey & oak. Sweet, sour & heavy fruity taste. Viscous, oily & fairly tannic astringent mouthfeel.

Superstition Berry White,"(1, 76)",4.3,"From notes. Enjoyed this at Mickey’s 30th birthday bash on November 05. 500 mL bottle. 2015 vintage. The pour is a dark purple with no head to be found. This is lovely. It is a little thin, but leaves great stain on the glass. The aroma is just awesome. There is a ton of sweetness that balances out. There is a ridiculous amount of raspberry and a light chocolate to it. The fruitiness and jamminess really pile on the sweetness, but I like it. There is just a hint of alcohol on the finish. The flavor is much of the same. Really rich and forward with the raspberry, light honey, and decent wine character on the back end. The mouth feel is a little thin, but this clings to the mouth and imposes its will all over you. The jammy raspberry is just lovely. This is a damn good mead."
Superstition Berry White,"(1, 77)",4.2,"Bottle shared with koleminer20 and Gus for the reunion of Meat Cloud and the Bird Dicks. Aroma is raspberry, booze, chocolate, sweet, good.

Superstition Berry White,"(1, 80)",4.2,"Bottle shared by daknole at RBWG: Poured a burgundy color with bubble head. Aroma slams you in the face with sweetness, fruits, berry jam, honey. Taste follows up with vanilla chocolate and berry blast."
Superstition Berry White,"(1, 81)",4.3,"2 oz sample from kcherney, huge thanks for this one! Deep purple leaving some nice legs on the glass. Like others from the Berry White series, the aroma is so intense with loads of raspberries and white chocolate along vanilla, honey, mild alcohol notes and perfumy/jammy notes. Taste is super sweet but balanced by an interesting mild acidity, intense raspberry jam filled with white chocolate chips, raspberry seeds, honey, alcohol (not burning) and vanilla. Full body. Still. Rich, thick and vinous mouthfeel. Super jammy finish with raspberies, white chocolate and nice alcohol warmth. Easier to drink than the Black Berry White I tried a few days ago. It’s super sweet, but so flavorful that it’s still somewhat drinkable (at least in small quanty). Extremely tasty, borderline too flavorful and sweet but it doesn’t crosses the ""cloying"" line. Great stuff."
Superstition Berry White,"(1, 82)",4.1,"Sampled this with Sparky accompanied by the rest of the Berry White’s. Dark violet hue that had sparkling amethyst at its edges. Still. Very sweet. Definitely can’t drink a ton of it, but in small quantities, it is incredible. Syrupy, thick, and chewy. Loads of raspberry, white chocolate, honey, vanilla, and oak. Love that these guys are practically in my backyard!"

Very good, but not as good as other Superstition meads I got to try that night."

Superstition Berry White,"(1, 89)",4.5,"Bottle shared by Daknole at RBWG. Thanks so much dude! One of my favorite beverages of the weekend. It pours a blood red color. The aroma is rich, decadent dessert. White chocolate truffles and fresh raspberry jam. Almost cake-like with raspberry filling. The flavor is the same. All the wonderful flavors of truffles and raspberry jam with sweet cherries only without the cloying sugar. More vanilla cake in the finish. Full bodied. So much dessert. Mind blowing stuff."
Superstition Berry White,"(1, 90)",4.7,"Beautiful Garnet color on the base of the white series. Huge nose of berries, chocolate but dominated by honey. These same flavors hit your palate with an intensity that is almost unexpected. These make me not want to drink any other meads!"

Superstition Berry White,"(1, 97)",4.3,"Bottle, pours a deep dark mahogany with almost no head. Nose is complex as hell, with notes of raspberry pith upfront, followed by treacle, honey and a little vanilla. Flavour is along the same lines, with loads of raspberry liqueur, followed by treacle, honey, and vanilla. Amazingly complex, with some serious heat that doesn’t burn. Excellent stuff."

Superstition Berry White,"(2, 1)",4.9,"Wow! Made the trek up to Prescott for some high country. Dropped into superstitions one year anniversary, this is such a pleasant comforting and cool space to hang out! Live music, fitting decor of a 'cellar' and friendly staff. 

Now to the mead, tried this one for the first time and I had to find a chair in an already crowded bar! Definitely sweeter, but clean and fresh finish. If you can find it, buy it!"

Superstition Berry White,"(2, 6)",5,"What can I say, this mead is one of, if not the best meads out there. Aroma of fresh raspberries,honey and white chocolate. The taste matches the aroma with a nice viscosity to coat your mouth in raspberry goodness. A true testament to the wonders of mead."
Superstition Berry White,"(2, 7)",3.7,"Small 3-4 ounce sample of this one in a trade. Stoked to finally try it. Pours a dense thick syrupy blue and purple. Major alcohol legs. Aroma is very boozy, almost grain-alcohol like with a ton of blueberry, currant, oak. Grape-like. very sweet. taste, also quite boozy, maybe needs some time to chill out in the cellar but the blueberry and chocolate are unmistakable and very present. Lingering blueberry finish. Really impressive."
Superstition Berry White,"(2, 8)",4.1,"Bottle. Pours clear deep lilac ruby mahogany. Aroma is sweet acidy raspberries fudge. Flavor is similar to aroma, acidity just Spotify on with the sweetness. Lovely."

Superstition Berry White,"(2, 13)",3.8,"Bottle @ home. Thanks, Isaiah. Blood red pour. Nice legs. Rich raspberry syrup and red wine on the nose. Chocolate sauce and raspberry covered cheesecake. Slight acidity to the flavor which helps to cut some of the intense sweetness. A lot of raspberry jam and syrup. Slightly seedy. Thick feel on the tongue. Slight booze."
Superstition Berry White,"(2, 14)",4.4,"on draught at Granite Mountain. Pours a rich, pinot color. Aroma is massive raspberry jam and white chocolate. Taste is quite sweet with the raspberry and white chocolate explosion coming through. Sticky texture. This is a wonderful mead."
Superstition Berry White,"(2, 15)",4.8,"Pours a deep berry purple. Aromas are insane, like an old fashioned candy store. Tons of white chocolate, and more berry aroma than a bramble patch of berries. Flavor is beyond intense. The berry flavor smacks you right in the mouth. It’s full on jammy berry. The white chocolate comes busting through with an intense, cocoa buttery sweetness. Make no mistake about it this is a dessert mead, a rather epic one at that. It’s on the fuller side of body ...rich, sweet without being overly so. This one blew my mind, and stopped just short of making my toes curl! World Class stuff right here."
Superstition Berry White,"(2, 16)",4.5,"Pours a deep reddish purple, aroma of white chocolate, raspberries and honey. Taste is sweet and tart, berries and white chocolate. Really complex. I could drink this all day!"
Superstition Berry White,"(2, 17)",4.8,"It...it’s freaking good. The nose is vanilla/cocoa butter with a hint of berry. It pours deep, thick purple...crazy legs on this one. It doesn’t tear...it coats. Taste is schmead-level berry, in the best possible way. Massive raspberry from start through a tart finish. The white chocolate keeps coming through on the aroma as you drink it, but rides on top of the berry. Sweetness from it, but really well balanced. White chocolate can be cloying as hell, but it works wonderfully here. I’d sip it as a dessert mead, but it’s plenty quaffable...I’m racing through thoughts trying to pair it appropriately with something other than cheese. It’s got enough sweetness to be moreso than many desserts and not fight them. My new fave from them, and that’s saying something..."
Superstition Berry White,"(2, 18)",4.8,"This was truly an Incredible Mead and would fall at the top of my favorite! Imagine a Rasberry Puree Reduced down with a white Chocolate Drizzle.

A wave of Rasberry hits your nose in the beautiful mead that just perfectly balances the Sweet and Tartness.

Given the Opportunity i would drink this all of the time over any other Mead ive had."
Superstition Berry White,"(2, 19)",4.7,Dark burgundy pour with aromas of berries and vanilla. The flavors of berries and Vanilla merry together beautifully. Hard to believe this isn't my favorite of the dayl
Superstition Berry White,"(2, 20)",4.4,"Bottle share courtesy of Dak, thanks! It pours with a rug staining deep dark rosy red to purple body that leaves behind thick glass staining legginess. The aroma hits with both slick sugary honey goodness and nectar like berry notes where there is a modest degree of sweet smooth sugary smelling vanilla off in the background. This smells great. The taste has a wonderful play between rich nectar like fresh sweet berry juice thickened by honey and then flowing into a smooth modest sweet kind of white chocolate seemingly vanilla note. This is well crafted and delivers a wonderful rich mix of honey, berry notes and vanilla. Love this, wow! This is right up there with some of the best I’ve been lucky enough to try. I had a splash of Schramm’s Statement to I can compare and to my surprise this was a little deeper richer and somehow embraced the fruit more. This is not Heart of Darkness good, but dang."
Superstition Berry White,"(2, 21)",4.8,"Deep burgundy pour. Aroma of nice berries and vanilla that reminds me of dessert. The taste of raspberry, blackberries and white chocolate. This was so crazy good, I licked the inside of the glass. WOW my favorite of their meads."
Superstition Berry White,"(2, 22)",5,"This might be the best mead I’ve ever had. And I’ve had a lot of them. I’ve had Schramm’s.  I’ve had Kuhnhenn.  I’ve had B. Nektar.  Pours a deep reddish purple.  Smells like chocolate raspberry amazingness.  I saw someone taking like two minutes just sniffing it before even taking the first sip because the smell was so pleasant.  Taste was absolutely delicious, decadent white chocolate and raspberry flavor. Very deep and very rich. To me, this mead is the very definition of a dessert wine. If you have ever had the Ben & Jerry’s Berry Voluntary ice cream (a Target exclusive flavor), it tastes EXACTLY like that, and trust me, that’s a very good thing.  Before you open one, do yourself a favor and put on Barry White’s ""Never, Never Gonna Give You Up"" (the full version).  It will put you in the right mood for drinking this mead.  Here, let me help you:  http://youtu.be/eLdSYF0WxyE?t=44s"
Superstition Berry White,"(2, 23)",4,"Bottle shared during a mead tasting hosted by daknole. Heavy aroma of blackberry and boysenberry, a sharp honey sweetness, some vanilla, a earthy vegetal tone and wet oak. Pours very dark purplish-blood red. An intriguing mesh of flavors explodes on the tongue with deep blueberry, a boozy heat, and moderately sweet honey with a tart finish. Thick palate for a mead (almost chalky), but it pairs well with the heavy taste. Very nice; one of my favorites so far from Superstition."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Stranahan's Whiskey Barrel Aged,"(1, 1)",4.5,"750 mL bottle. Unknown original review date, but sometime before June 26, 2012.
Jet black with a chocolate head. Inky and glass staining as always.

Whiskey is very dominant on the nose. All the flavors of whiskey, chocolate, and peppers come through in one whiff. They blend seamlessly into a great nose.

Tastes of whiskey up front, as the aroma would indicate. It’s a different aroma from Bourbon, which I didn’t quite expect. I thought I wouldn’t be able to discern a Whiskey barrel from a Bourbon barrel in a big beer like this. It’s less intense than a Bourbon barrel and allows the beer to come through. Chocolate and peppers not as well blended as in the aroma. The whiskey flavor is very sharp, especially in the finish.

Very thick. Seems to have retained its body better than Virgin Oak did. Very heavy and tough to drink. A sipper, I suppose.
Wonderful flavors, but it’s so big. The complexities of Hunahpu are a little lost from the barrel, but the barrel does well to accommodate."

Pours pitch black with a thick sticky reddish brown head. The nose is peppery, moderate cocoa, vanilla, and spices, with the Whiskey barrel initially supplying a strange note not noticed in the other barrel treatments. Everything ends up working very well together with this. The flavor is thick malty goodness with moderate sweetness and some roast. The chocolate is a blend of creamy and dark versions. The whiskey adds a complexity not found in the original. Vanilla, pepper and spices round things out. Medium-full bodied and quite smooth. The barrel notes are well integrated with the base beer."

Couleur noire huile de moteur laissant un léger filament huileux et doré sur le verre, ce dernier s’atténue rapidement. Le col de couleur moka se dissipe rapidement.
Arôme garde ici tout le bouquet généreux de Hunahpu tel que je m’en souviens. Malté, chocolat riche s’entrechoquent avec des notes d’épices suivi d’une rondeur boisée de whiskey donnant une pointe douce vanillée. Caramel sur côté toffee. La chaleur des piments reste modérée mais ajoute un bouquet subtile qui garde une pointe d’épice avec le renfort de la cannelle.
Palais est simplement sublime. Chocolat est profond et épais sur un léger pimenté qui vient titiller chaque gorgée. 
Le whiskey est doux, rondeur du boisé américain typique qui donne une belle douceur vanille en bouche. Cette dernière accompagne un palais très complexe. Retrouve un chocolaté généreux et épais agrémenté par cette fine chaleur de piments. Le tout couvre une pointe de fumé qui suit en fin de bouche.
Seul point négatif, bière à boire à t° de pièce mais qui en se réchauffant commence à prendre des notes de soja.

Reste une bière unique, qui se vaut d’être partagée. Du gros calibre à boire, que dis-je, à déguster tranquillement. Une expérience gustative. Le whiskey est subtile, présent mais sans pour cela dominer. Cela laisse à la version de base assez de place pour briller tout en profitant de mûrissage."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Stranahan's Whiskey Barrel Aged,"(1, 30)",4.3,"Appearance:
Blacker than black with a paper thing espresso crema head which fizzles into oblivion. Sucked in by a black whole maybe? Rests still and unwavering with a few trepid swirls leaving a black oily slick in its wake.


Nose:
Burnt black licorice. Pure unfettered cacao – brittle, bitter, roasty, and burnt espresso caramel crema. Sweet heat and spice along the sides and rounding out in the back. Whiskey soaked black chocolate covered raisins. Black cake.


Palate:
Intense but not intensely complex. Dark chocolate fudge and brownies. A silky mouthfeel carries each delicate flavor from beginning to finish. Spicy heat tickles the back of my throat with whisky and the cask it was previously aged int. Black root and more fudge mingle. Oily on the lips while dry and brittle on the tongue – cacao beans.


Final Thoughts:
Between the Rum and the Whiskey, I enjoyed both but if I had to lean in one direction, it would be in the direction of the rum. Both were amazing beers though and while I don’t know what new used barrel deliciousness Cigar City has in store for their next Hunahpu release, I’ll have to make sure I am there and ready."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Stranahan's Whiskey Barrel Aged,"(1, 33)",4.5,"A-- Pours like Hunahpu does. Thick, sludgy, oily, and black. Just huge. Beautiful reverse cascading head. Went from black leather to a dark mocha colored head. Two finger head that settled to a thick film. Just gorgeous looking. Big oily residue of ABV legs and sediment. Good spotty lacing. 

S-- Yikes. Chocolate fudge, marshmallow, cinnamon,an nutmeg. Barrel notes were soft but did get vanilla, oak, and carmel. Really thought the base beer somewhat overshadowed the barrel. Not complaining though. 

T-- Thick and rich. Massive array of flavors. Vanilla, chocolate fudge, marshmallow, cinnamon, oak, vanilla and carmel. Like drinking a thick milkshake.

M-- Thick and oily. Big but not overly big or sweet at all. Quite smooth really and still chewable at the same time. Low carbonation. What was really memorable was the chillies really made an impact in this. As in the heat in the mid an back palate. Had heartburn the next day from it. Nice touch. 

O-- Outstanding beer in every respect. Would have liked more of the barrel but in this beer it is more about the spices and what it adds. Yeah, I am a Stranahan homer and like the barrel treatments from them. Was quite fun to drink and would love to try again."

The aroma is the smoothest of the bunch, and the most subtle- whiskey, oak, molasses, toasted brown sugar, vanilla, and coconut. The chili pepper just barely peeks through.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Stranahan's Whiskey Barrel Aged,"(1, 56)",4.1,"Barrel-Aged Hunahpu’s tasting! Thanks to all the guys in the tasting group who helped make this happen.

The beer is, like all of the Hunahpu’s variants, profoundly dark. Ominous black with a thick, oily beige head. An awesome appearance for an imperial stout. Lacing stains the glass.

The aroma offers some whiskey/booze, roast. Again, not a grandiose aroma, but what’s there smells attractive.

The flavor is a bit more forward than the bourbon version, with a slight whiskey kick in the finish. Delicious.

Full bodied with moderately low carbonation. Smooth on the palate with alcohol pretty tame.

Overall, very good beer. Very glad for the opportunity to sample this."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Stranahan's Whiskey Barrel Aged,"(1, 57)",4,"Draft at Cigar City during Hunahpu Day 2012. 

Pours pitch black with a dark mocha head that quickly settle into a thick, lasting ring. Sporadic streaks of lace left behind. 

Strong barrel character in the aroma aroma with a prominent whiskey presence. Subtle toasted oak with sweet and roasted malt notes underneath.  Hints of chocolate, toffee, hazelnut and coffee.  Subtle vanilla and peppers.  Peppers seem to be muted by this treatment. 

Thick bodied and viscous with a strong barrel presence that gives off lots of whiskey and toasted oak that dominates the flavor.  Some vanilla and toasted coconut as well.   The strong barrel flavors are followed by sweet and roasted malts that become more prominent as it warms.  Lots of chocolate with a mix of sweet and roasted notes along with some coffee bean, caramel and toffee.  The cinnamon and peppery heat show up toward the finish but again are slightly muted by the strong whiskey flavor.  Decent amount of heat but abv is nicely masked.  Another solid Hunahpu treatment.  Viscous and complex yet still pretty easy to drink.  The barrel presence is a bit strong for my liking but it doesn’t hurt the flavor too much."

Rich, tawny barrel with excellent milk chocolate. Really nice nose here finally.  Taste is quite rich, spicy, with acidic lemon and sharp tangy dark chocolate. Really nice stuff here. Very dry and bitter palate. Not as lemon heavy as the Apple Brandy BA version and no green olive nose. Very dry in the palate though. Almost too dry. Paired this with some salted dark chocolate. Brings out some excellent body complexities. I like this version of Hunahpu, though I doubt it will ever be a favorite of mine.Subtle bite in the end with spicy cinnamon chocolate and lemon twang.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Stranahan's Whiskey Barrel Aged,"(1, 72)",4.7,"From notes.  First reviewed 10/31/2011.  Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip. Taste side by side with 2011 Hunahpu’s and the Virgin Oak Aged Hunahpu’s.

The pour is a gorgeous chocolate ebony color with a tightly wound chocolate colored creamy head. Eventually fading to a collar, a little bit of lace is left down the sides of the glass.

I did not think that Hunahpu’s aroma could improve, but aging in these whiskey barrels managed to do it. Sweet whiskey, dark chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, and a bit of coffee blend and balance ever so nicely.

The flavor is phenomenal as well. Dark chocolate works in with sweet whiskey flavors, cinnamon, vanilla, roasted malt, a bit of espresso and cream. Some light dry oak tannins come in toward the middle, mixing with more chocolate and whiskey toward the end. 

With an incredibly thick body, the flavors really have a chance to settle on the tongue. The carbonation is on the light side, which really lets all of the flavors come through. A strong sticky flavor rests on the tongue and lips. 

So balanced, so incredible. This is one of the top beers I have ever had."

The aroma offers up dark roasted maltiness, dark chocolate, chocolate flavored marshmallows, smooth sweet whiskey and faint chili pepper meat. The taste is smooth yet brighter and punchier after trying that rum treatment. I get smooth whiskey rolling into coconut, dark roasted maltiness and velvety dark chocolate goodness. I also get growing chili pepper heat that only attains a mild influence over the experience into finish on a velvety dark chocolate carpet ride, oh man! Great barrel time here where I get a pleasing dose of the amazing base beer but the whiskey didn’t lend the soft pillowy smoothness the rum treatment somehow mustered up."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Stranahan's Whiskey Barrel Aged,"(1, 79)",4,"Part of our Hunahpu’s vertical/horizontal tasting. Growler poured into tasting glass.

A - Like Hunahpu’s. Black, tan-colored head, thin collar, wisps.

S - The whisky is the perfect compliment to the base beer. The chili notes, smooth booze, oak, vanilla and chocolate are excellent. The spices aren’t all too forward, but you can pick them out, if you concentrate. 

T - Excellent stuff. I don’t really pick out any chili, but the chocolate sweetness of the base beer mixed with the whiskey is just delicious! Burnt sugars, oak, vanilla, chocolate, smooth booze and light char. All work together wonderfully.

M - Full body, rich and smooth, motor oil, creamy finish.

O - My favorite of the 2011 variants but not quite as good as the Brandy version from 2010. I think this will be even better in a year or so, as the booze is still pretty in-your-face (yet still excellent). Would search out again for sure!"

Pours a deep brown color with a thin light mocha head. Small cap and a bit of lacing. The nose carries some faint whiskey along with backing chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, and chiles. The base beer is much more prominent here than in the Rum and Bourbon versions. The flavor has a good whiskey backing plus chocolate, roast, and some nice spicing. Medium body with good carbonation. Quite tasty, but not quite at the level of the other barrel-aged blends. Boom."

Flavors are biscuity and bready, mild roast, chocolate, whiskey and boozy. Mild cinnamon. A bit of a dry chalkiness that I tend to get on all of the Hunahpu beers. Lighter carbonation. Very full bodied."

Beer is black with a thin brown head with some lacing, decent retention, moderate to low carbonation.

Aroma is sweet, oaky, strong liquor aroma, definitely bourbon / whiskey in the nose, quite strong.

This beer has a mild bite to it, strong, thinner than the virgin oak, boozier too, the whiskey and oak flavors sit on top of the backbone of the beer, interesting. The liquor is almost an after thought in this one, my third favorite of the night."

Taste: Whiskey, dark chocolate covered raisin, spirit soaked wood. Roasty aftertaste.



Mouthfeel: Silky thick , spicy bubbles.



Overall: An amazing tasty treat.  Call me crazy, but while this is at the top of my list of one of my favorite categories of beer, I’d probably take ’regular old’ Hunahpu over this hard to get beer."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Stranahan's Whiskey Barrel Aged,"(1, 89)",4,"750 ml bottle from fishingnet. Thanks, Ben! Pours a rich thick blackish hue, dark and black ominous. Opaque and inky. A thicker dark brown head sits atop, cakes and laces well. Aromas are chocolate chip cookies, some whiskey, oak, vanilla, and gentle spice. Some mellow vanilla, lots of cocoa, roasty and sweet caramel, toffee, and biscuits. Gentle toast. Vanilla and touches of cinnamon touch, but pepper seems muted. A touch of butter and creamy caramel. Initial is thick and big, an enveloping way of cocoa and caramel, roast and toast. Whiskey, vanilla and oak tannins, gentle spirit. Big and rich, offering some good big flavors. A bit sweet. Into the middle touches of spice and more sweet and barrel presence, the pepper doesn’t show up till the finish and lingers a bit. Gentle spice, mellow whiskey, big sweet and roasty melange of flavors. The ashy and roast, some smoke and gentle pepper picks up in finish and lingering on. Still covers up the cinnamon too much. The barrel is well executed and plays well, but I still think the barrel and aging with this beer covers up some of the best stuff about Hunah. Very nice. Significantly thicker and sweeter than the base 2011. Still love the base more but this is a very nice beer. The nuance of the regular is just lost fairly easily here, some pepper still remains but all that life from the cinnamon and toast, vanilla and even pepper strength. Great beer.. But when you drink it side-by-side with the base, it’s just hard to compare."

Again with a thick viscous pure deep black hue and topped with a moderate darker tan head that receded to a thin ring around the edges of the glass... Butterscotch and caramel upfront in the aroma with softer more mellow whiskey notes. Vanilla surfaces more through the middle and finish.  Soft to moderate pepper nicely finishes things off... Flavors fail to deviate much from the aroma with solidified with charred chocolate oites to pair alongside a soft gentle whiskey presence. A light to medium pepper presence meshes nicely late and prolongs through the finish. Thick consistency throughout. Nicely executed. Original > whiskey > virgin oak at this point.

Oh my god this is delicious!  The depth of the taste is incredible, the beer starts out whiskey and oak and finishes with lingering notes of dark chocolate/chocolate chips.

Got this big waft of dark chocolate fudge, little bit of ripened banana and a mellow bit of vanilla . . . I could have sworn I was about to eat a banana split! The palate followed in step with the exception of the banana which had disappeared. Cinnamon, vanilla, cocoa and a faint touch of chili. I was happy except it left e wondering what happened to the whiskey. But I did not wonder that for long!

Taste is slightly boozy but not much for such a big beer. Tastes like fudge and mocha with some roast and vanilla notes coming through. I like the whiskey and alcohol notes being in the background, adding a nice balance to this one. The heat is not lost at all from the chiles and a definite earthy tone gained from them is very appealing. Overall, this is a wonderful beer that everyone should have the chance to try."

Full-bodied and chewy with laid-back carbonation.  The burnt, bittersweet flavor is a medley of fudge, vanilla, coconut and unsweetened dark chocolate. A touch acrid. Finishes burnt and moderately bitter. As usual, the Stranahan’s barrel has added so much to the base beer while taking away so very little.

Rich dark toasted to roasted malts, bits of licorice, and cocoa nibs. Dark fruits with prunes, dates and The acidity is rather high which cuts the thickness, but distracts slightly. Alcohol is fairly well hidden and does not distract. I wish I liked licorice a bit more than I do (just not a fan/personal taste). Still a well put together brew.

Bell's Black Note Stout,"(1, 14)",4,"2016 bottle, thanks to Brett. Pours black, with a thin, bubbly, brown head. The aroma is mocha, cinnamon, dark chocolate, light soy, vanilla, and charred oak. Sweet and malty, with a mild, roasty bitterness. Heavy body, with a sharp, grainy mouthfeel. This is a bold, spicy, and aggressive stout. Nice."
Bell's Black Note Stout,"(1, 15)",3.9,"Keg at the Beavertown Extravaganza, day one, 08/09/17. A jet black coloured pour with a loose tan head. Aroma is nutty earthy roast, mineral, blacked roast.

Bell's Black Note Stout,"(1, 16)",4.3,"Flaska från trade, vintage 2012. Svart med liten brun krona. Låg kolsyra. I doft och smak bourbon, toffee, kaffe, salmiak, tjärpastill, mörk choklad, likörpralin, lite marsipan, viol, kaffesump. Riktigt jämn och fin med en mjuk och rund kropp. Smakerna har mognat och integrerats väl. Bra balans mellan sötma och mer rostade toner/kärvhet. Åldrats med värdighet samtidigt som det nog var hög tid att dricka den. Mycket fin impy av den gamla skolan."
Bell's Black Note Stout,"(1, 17)",2.4,Chocolate with dark fruits.  I was very disappointed given the high expectations.  Sour taste that does not sit well with me.  I bought 4 bottles of the beer and every time I tried a new one it was the same disappointing feeling.  Finally I finished the last bottle. Too bad!  I will stay away from this one.

Sweet chocolate and bourbon aroma.  Flavors are chocolate, molasses, dark fruit, dark sweet malt, burnt bitter espresso, vanilla, bourbon, toasty oak.  Low carb, velvety texture.  Alcohol is there but not overpowering. Long lasting warming bourbon, fudge, coffee, barrel finish.  Absolutely delicious."
Bell's Black Note Stout,"(1, 22)",4.8,"Bottle date 10/10/17, aged 14 months. Pours almost jet black with 1/4"" head that slowly dissipates.  World class in virtually every aspect.  The key to this stout is its magnificent balance of aromas and flavors.  Tastes of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, and anise.  Full mouth feel, smooth carbonation.   Finishes semi-sweet, and then dry with a slight hops bite.  Nothing is clingy or cloying about this beer.  This beer has been discontinued with 2017 being the last year of bottling.  Have two more I will set for 2019 and 2020.  Awesome beer."

Bell's Black Note Stout,"(1, 30)",4.3,"2017 Bottle
Pours very viscus black hue with a slightly fizzy brown head that didnt last that long. What was left was just around the rim of the glass. Nose Is amazing-lots of char, wood, dark malts, broubon heat, slight licorice, anise, lots of coffee. Flavors are very rich, much like the nose-lots of char, wood, wonderful dark sweetness, slight alcohol but well hidden considering the abv. Finish goes on forever-lots of bourbon, lovely caramel, toffee, char and some roast. This is an amazing brew, probably hands down Bells best beer."

Aroma is cherry, fudge, raisin, bourbon/alcohol (slightly like rubbing alcohol first taste), oak, light roast. Taste is dark fruit, dark chocolate, complemented by subtle bourbon and light oak. Palate is medium-to-full bodied with velvety smooth texture, pleasant alcohol warmth, soft-to-average carbonation and finish with sweet dark fruit offset by a splash of coffee/burnt marshmallow character. Overall, tremendous beer with full flavors yet nothing over the top. Alcohol is a little strong, especially at the anniversary mark, but mellowed after another 6 months aging (will have to let the other two age a bit and revisit)."
Bell's Black Note Stout,"(1, 35)",4.3,"Bottle at home bought in San Diego, Bottlecraft, 7th September 18. Pours black with a nice dark tan head. Aroma is liquorice, wood, vanilla, bourbon.

Great beer."

Mid palate gives way to intense cedar wood, heavily charred oak, campfire ash, cigar smoke, charcoal, sawdust, burnt dark malts, vanilla, honey, maple syrup, bourbon, corn syrup, leather and crystallized caramel. Finishes boozy with more barrel wood, cedar wood, bourbon, licorice, toasted coconut, strong roasted black coffee, coffee beans and coffee oils.

Bell's Black Note Stout,"(1, 40)",3.9,"12oz bottle from Canal's, 2017 marked on the label (PKG 10/05/2017), 11.2% abv for this round. Nose is room filling barrel character (oak / Bourbon?) and somewhat lesser chocolate and coffee. Pour straight pitch with a surprisingly large rocky tan head. Taste is dominated by barrel character and alcohol, some heat, some mild burn, but spirited and fumy without heavy fusel contribution -- I'm impressed if that was the goal. Deep warmth along the throat, touch sugary but never sweet, per se; lower bitterness than expected, probably low-medium or even just plain low; dark roast, inky dark malt character that's unfortunately marred/surpassed by oily alcohol. Medium body with light edges but the flavors are just sledgehammers. Clean throughout, hint of yeast here and there, no soy. There's a bit of fruit, mostly grape, pairing very nicely with cream (in taste and texture), espresso aftertaste, but the overall effect is closer to a marriage of Slivovitz and Kahlua than beer. That being said, a reasonably fun one, if expectations have been adjusted. [2018.08.03: 3.9]"

Black pour with a tan to dark tan head that lasts. Aroma is wood, vanilla, ash, roast, coffee, chocolate, notes of darker fruit. Fairly full bodied, moderate to high creaminess, ash and roast flavors present with chocolate, pleasant, decadent. It's crazy how much the standard for BA imperial stouts have evolved. This is still really nice, but I don't find it 'wow status' either compared to the plethora of other BA offerings. If I rated this 12 years ago it would have been an absolute world beater and then some. The shadows betray you because they belong to me."

Bell's Black Note Stout,"(1, 48)",4.2,"Apparence : Noire, léger col brun foncé, rétention faible, petites bulles moyennement actives, fine dentelle. 

Nez : Bourbon, malt rôti, chocolat, fudge, café. 

Goût : Fut de bourbon et chocolat dominants, malt grillé, finale bien distincte des arômes de café de qualité. Tout de même sucrée, légère amertume. 

Sensation : Corps moyen, bonne longueur, touche épicée sur la langue. 

Bref : Pour moi, cette bière a deux grandes qualités. D'abord, l'équilibre des notes maltées grillées, des apports aromatiques du fut, du sucre résiduel et de l'amertume. Une belle maîtrise. Ensuite, la transition entre les notes mentionnées et une finale bien distinctive sur le café est fort intéressante. Belle complexité. Puis-je m'avancer par contre en disant qu'elle aurait pu avoir un peu plus de corps (et si je veux vraiment aller plus loin, de ''punch'')?"

Pitch black body, with a small, creamy, dark beige head.
Very smooth aroma of bourbon, coffee, dark chocolate, soy sauce, liquorice, toffee, some vanilla, some coconut, some dark fruits.

Medium, oily mouthfeel, with a moderate carbonation. 
Finishes dry, roasty, a bit sweet, a bit boozy, wooden, with bourbon, coffee, dark chocolate, liquorice, tobacco, some soy sauce. 

Delicious! Smooth and greatly balanced, with the bourbon barrel very well integrated, not too dominant. The alcohol presence is also very well dosed. Lovely dry roastiness towards the finish. Not my favourite bourbon BA Imperial Stout, but close, really amazing stuff."

Inky, ebony with very little light making it through the edges. No head, even after a vigorous pour and some warming....
So at a full six years of age, you can't really fault a beer for being well past its prime. That being said, this was specifically designed to lay down, which I did, since acquiring it young, in a wine fridge. So I was, I think understandably/justifiably, VERY disappointed when this thing was just plain DEAD. I mean, I could understand if it was well past its prime or something, but this was just fully oxidized soy sauce. Will certainly get a bottle to rerate and just put in an average placeholder score. Bells instills no confidence any more and I can't remember too many good beers I've had from them in the past 10 years. 2002 Expedition stout, in a 12oz capped bottle no less, aged FAR, FAR better and longer than this piece of crap."

Kawa espresso tworzy drugi plan, niestety z wyczuwalnymi objawami utlenienia w postaci sosu sojowego. Nie jest on bardzo nachalny, ale mi skutecznie pomniejsza radość degustacji. W tle odnajdziemy nuty wanilii i szlachetnego alkoholu. 
W smaku piwo jest gęste, oleiste i bardzo gładkie na języku. Każdy łyk zdaje się wypełniać całą jamę ustną, dominując swym smakiem. Gorzka czekolada, kawa i susz owocowy tworzą piękną kompozycję. Uzupełniają je posmaki związane z leżakowaniem w beczce - wanilia i kokos. Finisz jest wytrawny, z palonymi posmakami i średnio-wysoką popiołową goryczką. Alkohol rozgrzewa, ale jest szlachetny."

Some prune and fig as it warms. Smooth finish, with lingering chocolate cream and bourbon notes. Wow. A flawless beer."

Ogólnie jest przesiąknięte kokosem, w tej kwestii jest idealne. Gdyby miało jednak do tego jakąś fajną kawowo/czekoladową kontrę to byłoby idealnym piwem. Tak jest tylko i aż piwem bardzo dobrym."

Bell's Black Note Stout,"(2, 1)",4.4,"2016 bottle. Man oh man what a stout. Huge waves of chocolate, coffee, roast, anise, and molasses, all slathered on black cherry and fig and raisin notes, backed up by a firm espresso bitterness overflowing with vanilla and oak and booze. Layers upon layers, lacking any alcohol warmth to mar the indulgent velvet feel. Aroma gives off tons of chocolate and bourbon. Thick viscous black pour gives up a brief white head and no lace. Brilliant."
Bell's Black Note Stout,"(2, 2)",4.5,"Release 2014 from bottle: Pours Black oily color, clear, with brown creamy stable finger head. Visually low carbonation. Aroma: rich dark, roasted malts aroma, which takes on espresso coffee, bittersweet chocolate, cacao nibs, hint of vanilla, oak, tabacco, oak, and full basket of hops, which takes on dried and dark fruits.
Flavor is very similar: intense, rich malt flavors, with notes, mentioned above, with hint of molasses, supported with bourbon alcohol warmth. 
Finish is slightly sticky/dry. Body is full, texture is silky smooth, carbonation is low.
I am a little bewildered: for 10$ is hard to get better BA Imperial stout.

Bell's Black Note Stout,"(2, 12)",3.1,"Appearance: Pours an inky, black body with a sustained, light sandy-beige head.

Smell: Char-hinting heavy roastiness with a crust of bitter dark chocolate, with lesser touches of dark fruit, vanilla-infused molasses, woodsiness and peppery alcohol.

Taste: Bulky roastiness, a bit ashen and chary and laden with booziness and soy. Rolls sweet to bitter (charred) with a salient, less-than-satisfying alcohol presence coupled with woody tannins. A bit of dark chocolate, licorice, gummy molasses and prune. The nose held a bit more promise, though the heavy char, soy and booze leave it lopsided and unbalanced.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Light carbonation.

Overall: Downright overhyped."

Praktycznie w ogóle nie czuć nut alkoholowych w aromacie. Ponadto dojrzałe, ciemne owoce w tle. Smak słodki, momentami nawet bardzo, końcówka goryczkowa, długo utrzymująca się. Posmak kawowy - kawa z mlekiem, gładki, ułożony. Siła tego piwa leży w jego prostocie i harmonii. Nie jest jakieś bardzo złożone, słody palone nie przegięte, jak jest kawa to wygładzona, beczka bardzo dobrze wkomponowana - nie uderza alkoholem. CIało praktycznie perfekcyjne.

This is outstanding."

I thought it would be more bourboney based on the nose, but this is rich, dark chocolate mostly. Dark, mind you, like 85% cacao chocolate. I’m always impressed when a beer genuinely tastes like something else, and this is one of those beers. No alcohol burn. I see why this is so sought after. I prefer a bit more bourbon flavor, however."

Tastes oddly of dark fruits off the bat but follows with a nice chocolatey sweetness and a small roast coffee. Bourbon heat and flavor throughout which is pretty nice. Small mouthfeel. Pretty thin not leaving much in the aftertaste. Overall the flavor is pretty good, not great. The smell is great and the body is iffy. Good."

Notes of bourbon, milk chocolate, roasted coffee as well as brewed coffee, vanilla, a bit of toasted coconut, toffee, with espresso-like coffee in the post-taste. Full bodied, soft texture. A great imperial stout, the bourbon, roast and sweetness are perfectly balanced. Just a bit alcoholic in the end, probably due to its freshness (bottled Nov 2016)."

Bell's Black Note Stout,"(2, 45)",4.9,"Pours a dark black with some brown, very thin head, splotchy lacing, but who the heck cares one bit about a slight ding on appearance after a single sip of this stuff. Aroma of espresso, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, some roast. Flavor follows, full coffee stout in effect, bourbon complementing things very well, coming in firm but gentle after an espresso roast cleans up an initial sweet chocolate. The progression is absurdly impressive, super well-designed, a work of science of the senses. Mouthfeel is tauntingly sticky initially but it becomes silky and fades so nicely. Fine hobbies and pursuits I have, many pleasures in life are not to abandon, but this elixir is to die for. OK, I’m caught up in the moment, but wow. Thanks, R!"

The bourbon was not over powering."

Bell's Black Note Stout,"(2, 53)",4.3,"Poured black with brown foam, just what you’d expect from a stout. The smell had me concerned with so much bourbon.

Bell's Black Note Stout,"(2, 57)",5,"6-ty RIS na świecie wypity w ostatni dzień 2016 roku. Nowy Rok przywitałem w wielkim stylu.

Legenda powraca z podwójną siłą beczki po bourbonie.

Piwo na które polowałem od lat. Wiele mnie kosztowało zachodu, aby je nareszcie zdobyć. 
A ile przy tym musiał przejść mój człowiek w USA, to tylko on sam wie. Udało mu się je zdobyć w jednym, jedynym miejscu w Nowym Jorku.

Jeszcze raz dziękuje Wojtek Zawadzki za Twoje zaangażowanie. 


 Alkohol:  10,8% obj. 


 Data rozlewu:  07.01.16 


 Kolor:  Czarny jak smoła, kompletnie nieprzejrzysty. 


 Piana:  Gęsta, beżowa, wysoka, sztywna jak dobrze ubita śmietana.
Tworzy jedną warstwę puchu. Doskonale krążkuje na szkle.
Opada do chmurki.
Po zakręceniu pokalem idzie do góry pozostawiając na ściankach setki kropeczek. 


 Zapach:  Przyłożyłem końcówkę butelki do nosa i po paru chwilach mówię sam do siebie: ""Oddychaj głęboko, nie zemdlej"".
Żadne słowa nie są w stanie opisać nawet części tego aromatu.
Kolosalna wanilia, przepotężny kokos, gigantyczne wpływy mokrej dębiny, drewna, zbutwiałych desek.
Nuty beczkowe paraliżują zmysły i wprawiają w osłupienie.
Po odkopaniu się spod tego ogromnego beczkowego pancerza powoli zaczynają docierać do mózgu inne aromaty. 
A jest tego co niemiara. Pokazuje się intensywna szwajcarska czekolada, pralinki z alkoholem w środku, nuty najlepszej na świecie kawy, melasy, brownie, ciasta typu murzynek, crème brûlée, panna cotta i cała masa innych znanych mi genialnych i słodkich deserów.
Miazga! Sztos! Niekwestionowane 10/10! 


 Smak:  Po pierwszym łyku odebrało mi po prostu mowę.
Bourbon zrobił tu tak nieprawdopodobną robotę.
Tony wanilii, kolosalny kokos, dębina, karmel, drewno, czekolada, belgijskie pralinki, kawa espresso, orzechy włoskie, bezy z ubitego białka, ponownie crème brûlée.
Czego tutaj jeszcze nie ma.
Tekstura zbita, oleista, gęsta jak kisiel.
Goryczka zaskakująco wysoka, ale krótka z orzechowo-kawowym tłem.
Niemal 11% alkoholu rozgrzewa w piersi i mile łechce podniebienie. Gładki, kremowy, aksamitny. Odczucie w ustach wręcz bajkowe.
Trunek arcymistrzowski, degustacyjny, wytworny. Sztos jakich mało! 


 Wysycenie:  Niskie. 


 Podsumowanie:  


31 grudzień 2016 -zapamiętam tę datę na długo. Po ponad setce wypitych RIS-ów odnalazłem
swój ideał stylu.
Black Note jest piwem WYBITNYM. 
Nigdy nie spotkałem na swojej drodze RIS-a tak złożonego smakowo i zapachowo, zarazem tak zbalansowanego, kremowego i z taką potężna beczkową wanilią i kokosem.
Piwo jest warte każdych pieniędzy. Jakbym tylko mógł wsiadłbym w samolot do USA i przemierzał całe Stany w poszukiwaniu tego trunku.

Nie ma nic lepszego niż zakończyć ten rok w tak spektakularnym stylu.

Życzę Wam wszystkim na ten Nowy Rok 2017, aby każdy z Was odnalazł swój ideał."

Bell's Black Note Stout,"(2, 59)",4.1,"12 oz bottle poured, gifted by Pruf. Huge thanks! Great way to start the new year. Black pour with a lasting cola fizz head. Chocolate malt aroma, slight dough, and hints of bourbon aroma. Flavor is dark fruit, bold, dark chocolate, and a smooth and delicious bourbon. A fantastic stout here. I wish I had Bells at my local. So good."
Bell's Black Note Stout,"(2, 60)",4.5,"12-ounce bottle pour from a four-pack I picked up as an Xmas gift to myself. Pours pitch black with a dark tan head that rapidly develops from the prickly natural carbonation, then quickly dissipates. Aroma is of prunes, dates, figs, smoke. Taste is all of these fruits, dried, with dark chocolate, vanilla, espresso, and a bourbon smokiness followed by a balancing hop bitterness (although still on the sweet side). Mouthfeel is slick, oily, creamy with medium-full body. A very goo bourbon-barrel-aged sweet stout. A noble cousin to Expedition Stout."
Bell's Black Note Stout,"(2, 61)",4.1,"This is the first chance I’ve had to try Bell’s Black Note Stout, and I think this beer deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the hard to find, crazy expensive stuff. It’s that good. Black Note pours black with crimson highlights and basically no head at all (11.5% ABV). The aroma is huge baker’s chocolate and vanilla. Big, rich, a lot of punch, just a tremendous smelling beer. The flavor is delicious. That chocolate and vanilla are right there, and the bourbon barrel comes through strong on the finish. Coffee and toffee notes, and roasted nuts are also a presence. This is fantastic beer."

Flavor is rich dark chocolate, velvety cocoa, light bourbon-barrel notes, coffee, bit of toffee, maybe a spot of cinnamon. This thing has crazy silky smooth mouthfeel. I’d say the selling point here is mouthfeel. One of the smoothest bourbon barrel beers I’ve had. It’s very good, but I don’t know that this thing is the best of the best."
Bell's Black Note Stout,"(2, 63)",3.7,"Bottled: 11/03/16, sampled: 12/28/16. Pours black but not very thick & oily. Almost no head but coats the glass with strands of lace. Aromas are soft & subdued; bourbons notes come through first and then chocolates, dried fruits, & coffee following. Arrives with nice oak, vanilla, and fruit notes; transitions into a malty middle backed up by coffee & caramel. Ends with bittersweet cocoa and booze. Doesn’t warm up well; becomes too boozy, astringent, and sour. Finishes dry and long. Medium mouthfeel, no carb, and a moderate warmth of alcohol. Overall really delicious, complex, and balanced but wished there was more chocolate throughout. Not as amazing as it was hyped up to be but still a decent BBA imperial stout."
Bell's Black Note Stout,"(2, 64)",4.6,"Poured a dark brown/ black colour with a thin toffee head. Aroma is raisins, plums, chocolate, and vanillin with light notes of booze. Flavor is similar with a soft malty bitterness on an otherwise smooth finish. Happy that this lived up to the hype."
Bell's Black Note Stout,"(2, 65)",4.4,"12 ounce bottle, 2016 vintage, packaged on 11/03/2016. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch and a half tan head that stayed around for a while. There’s also a decent amount of lacing. I like the aroma, the brew smells like vanilla, bourbon, dark fruit, molasses, dark chocolate, and coffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there’s also some caramel and burnt/charred malt noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it’s creamy and coating with a moderate amount of carbonation. I thought this was pretty good, glad I was able to find a bottle. I know I’d like to try this again in the future! $7.99 a bottle."

Bell's Black Note Stout,"(2, 68)",4.5,"12 oz. bottle, 2016 version, 11.2% ABV, purchased from Craft Beer Cellar on Black Friday. Aroma contains molasses, dark chocolate, bourbon barrel, vanilla and booze. Jet black with a dark brown head that instantly recedes to nothing. Tastes rich and decadent - milk chocolate, roasted malts, slight hop profile offering some balance, nice full bourbon barrel/oak, not overly sweet, wonderful aftertaste. Smooth palate with only a slight booze burn. This is truly great; I can’t wait to try an aged bottle."
Bell's Black Note Stout,"(2, 69)",4.7,"2016 vintage. Thick viscous black pour with minimal beige head that forms a ring. Great barrel aroma.

Phenomenal beer."
Bell's Black Note Stout,"(2, 70)",3.9,"Very dark pour with almost no head. Smells of anise, bourbon, dusty bookshelf, roasted hop, coffee, dark chocolate. Thick creamy dark chocolate taste with plenty of roasted hoppiness. Reminds me of a creamier smoother version of Expedition. Booze is well hidden, very little burn. Hop bitter becomes background after a few sips and you can better pick out the bourbon notes. Some dark fruit in there as well."

Bell's Black Note Stout,"(2, 83)",4,"330 ml bottle. Looks mega viscous and pours pitch black with a creamy beige head. Aroma dominated by sweet bourbon with some chocolate, raisin, dark malts and vanilla. Not excessively boozy despite the bourbon. Velvety smooth, rich and very full bodied. Substantial sweetness, but pretty nicely balanced and bourbon is subtle ish on tasting. Some carbonation but defo soft. Crazily long finish with plenty of sweetness, very pleasant bitterness and lots and lots of bourbon. Can understand the hype, but I would probably take good ol expedition over this. Bit of a barrel bomb. As bottle goes on it turns into a bit of a bourbon fug. Bourbon BAged beers get inflated scores on ratebeer - don’t drink the Kool-Aid. Good, not great"

Oily without being fat and with just enough carbonation to prickle a bit on the tip of the tongue. Great! Aftertaste is good too with a bunch of notes I really cant pinpoint too well.

Incredibly inviting nose with sweet and spicy bourbon barrel notes excellently integrated into the elements of the base beer. Spicy whiskey/bourbon with toasted oak and vanilla. Toasted coconut and vanilla notes really stand out along with the dry, earthy oak presence. Underneath, there’s some luscious chocolate, licorice, vinous fruit, oatmeal and toast. Smells amazing!!! 

Viscous and full bodied with a strong bourbon presence that is perfectly integrated into the flavors of the base beer. Some dry toasted oak and spicy bourbon along with smooth vanilla bean and roasted coconut. Again, the toasted coconut flavor is realy prominent and the vanilla rounds out the hot booze. Great bourbon flavor. Underneath, there is a nice combination of sweet and roasted malt notes with hints of dark chocolate, burnt sugar, toast, oatmeal and coffee bean coutered by licorice and vinous fruits. Slightly dry in the finish with a good amount of boozy heat and warmth in the chest. Abv not masked very well but the base beer flavors aren’t obliterated and it’s still somewhat easy to drink.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"(1, 30)",4.6,"One of the most sought after versions of BCBS, vintage of 2013; my bottle says 14.1% ABV instead of the 13.9% ABV given above. I taste this special treat from an old port wine snifter at near room temperature. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, near to black but not entirely so; only in the last remnants of the liquid, a cloudy brown appearance reveals itself, with tiny bits of dead yeast and proteins lining the glass wall.  The head is thin, beautifully deep beige and a bit coarse, but is sadly reduced to an irregular, wafer-thin rim around the glass in instants. I passionately fall in love with the aroma: what a divine bouquet rises up from the bottle... I could sniff this for hours on end: deep dark chocolate sauce, raisins, candied figs, vanilla-like oaky tannins, Islay whisky, liquorice, old sherry, soy sauce, candied orange, eucalyptus syrup, espresso, cocoa powder, cedar wood, pear syrup, Worcestershire sauce, some cooked meat or fried eggs far away but not disturbing at all, and indeed a faint hint of coconut, though I suspect this volatile aroma has faded considerably in the course of almost two years. The taste amazes me even more: a complex and baffling experience indeed, starting off with a very dense, pointy, refined, concentrated, candied sweetness, cloying a bit to the lips, candied oranges, pear, dried dates and indeed a hint of dry coconut meat; a tinge of carbonation pierces through, as well as subtle sourish and salty accents (red berries and soy sauce). Then a profound chocolate maltiness unfolds in all its glory, bitter chocolate with caramel and cashew nuts, spreading over the tongue and mouth cavity, with a fat, oily mouthfeel; a wonderful symphony of sweet versus bitter, with a lively, almost faintly clove- and cinnamon-like spiciness to it (perhaps the rye whisky already speaking?). Bitter wins in the end, as - almost unexpectedly - a tangy yet still mellow roasted coffee ’blackness’ appears, almost cappuccino-like in combination with the bittersweet chocolate, warming and filling the back of the mouth. Even before I swallow the first sip, it is clear to me that this beer increases in complexity as it makes its way through the palate; the finish beautifully recaptures the whole taste trail from beginning to end, blending the candied sweetness, the bittersweet chocolate malts and the softly roasted coffee bitterness into one concentrated ’ball’ of taste, which is finally confronted with a big wave of warming, whisky-like alcohol which also remains on the tip of the tongue after swallowing but somehow manages to remain gentle in all its force; a clear, drying, tannin-like woodiness ensues, as well as a background hint of peppery, leafy, noble hops adding a subtle, double bass-like structure to the whole. The complexity and richness of the malts, including a warm sense of high quality, aromatic coffee and again the woody tannins, linger for hours after swallowing and the alcohol warms the heart... Things just keep happening here, no matter how many sips you’ve taken.  Though I have to admit I expected more coconut presence, this is still one of the most noble stouts I ever had the pleasure to enjoy. I particularly appreciate the follow-up of tastes in this one, sweet and bitter and bitter and sweet all make their appearance one by one only to lead to a resolving climax, as in a classical drama, though I did find the alcohol and the cloying sweetness perhaps a tad over the top - I had the same experience with AleSmith’s Speedway Bourbon Barrel Aged, and like in the case of the latter, this is the only thing keeping me from giving both stouts a perfect score.  Obviously, in view of this beer’s complexity and greatness, this is only the slightest form of criticism, if any; both remain unforgettable and both surely belong to the best beers I ever tasted.  This one, too, is a slow sipper for sure, to be treated with graciousness, dignity and respect. It is obvious that a lot of thought went into this beer; it is as if the malts were selected especially to fit in with the spirit of the barrel in which it has aged (and frankly, I would not be surprised if this is indeed deliberate). Fantastic example of the style, definitely worth the money (which was quite considerable, needless to say...). A world-class masterpiece, that is beyond doubt. I will remember this for the rest of my existence and I will keep the empty bottle in my cellar, only to look at it every now and then with a feeling of nostalgia..."

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"(1, 39)",4.1,"Bottle from Dan, thank you very much!

Pours a viscous, jet black color with no head, while some chunks of coconut float in the brew.

Sweet aromas of cane sugar, toffee, molasses, and burned coconut. These blend well into wooden, slightly boozy, hot barrel qualities, among bakers chocolate.

Has an incredible smooth mouthfeel, super creamy, drinks like chocolate with loads of cocoa nibs and glazed, slightly burned coconut. The bourbon acts as an intriguing counterpart to that, providing wood and earthy maltiness without revealing any booziness, less intense than the sweeter parts of the stout, still easily balancing the beer. Instead of a noteable carbonation, there is smooth creaminess, heading into a mousse au chocolate direction. The Bourbon in this beer is by no means dominant on its own, but blends perfectly into the chocolate qualities. Finishes with dark chocolate, as well as an appealing, lingering bourbon note."

Making a beeline for the Goose Island tent as soon as the gates opened I was able to get two pours of this amazing imperial stout. A world class release, this version of Bourbon County Stout made the ticket worthwhile on its own. While I am unlikely to pick up a bottle because of the cost I look forward to trying a few more at festivals and other special tappings.



Aroma / Appearance - An inky black base with long legs creeps from the pitcher into the glass. Anise, coffee, chocolate, and heavy booze rise into the air like dense smoke. Vanilla accents add even more depth. The Templeton Rye peeks out from time to time but due to the general heaviness does not stand out on its own.



Flavor / Palate - Strong malt, coffee, smoke, and Templeton Rye stick to the tongue and throat. Chewy after just a few seconds, the mouthfeel offers something for everybody as it crawls to a bitter warm finish. Despite all that it never feels suffocating. Six to eight ounces would be a perfect pour as I’m not sure I could finish much more on my own in one sitting without having a whole evening."

Taste was very, very big chocolate and loads of coconut in this one initially. Not being a big fan of coconut, I wished there was more char/roasted malt present across the middle. More chocolate joined forces with the bourbon to provide a pretty nice finish. Still, I thought it was a bit boozy. Definitely one of the better, if not the best Bourbon County variant I have had."

 The appearance notes are basically the same, Opaque, oily, small minimal head or lace. Rich bourbon, vanilla, charred oak, coffee mocha, leather, tobacco, and burnt coconuts are the aroma and flavor profile notes. One thing that was different was that the tap offering seemed much heavier of both coconut and chocolate and less roasty notes. Very smooth with excellent dark fruits undertones but missing the charred character needed for balance. I much liked the bottled offering more than the tap...

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"(1, 94)",4.2,"Bottle shared by badnewsbeers. Deep murky brown-black body, no head. Rich deep chocolate and coffee nose with dusty, earthy wood and coconut. The body hits first with warming alcohol, coconut, and wood, backed by firm slick chocolate, coffee, and roast. Hints of cinnamon, spice, and dark fruit. Leathery. Lots of barrel and the oxidation has softened the body. Rich and powerful."
Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"(1, 95)",4.4,"Bottle thanks to Russell. Pours a dark brown with small frothy beige head that diminishes to nothing with coconut flake floaties. The aroma is a strong coconut, chocolate, roast, and oak. Thick mouthfeel with strong coconut, chocolate, rye, roast, oak, with nice sweet finish. Very impressive."
Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"(1, 96)",4.5,"On tap poured into a snifter. Dark chocolate, cherries caramel, bourbon and brandy, vanilla bean and rich raisin aromas pour out of this one with a bit of wood. It’s a dark, very close to opaque, coffee brown, with a dark brown head. It has a runny lace that leaves the glass relatively clean with a wispy layer and thick ring around the edges retained. It’s highly sweet with a touch of bitterness in the finish. It’s thick, chewy, syrupy with a full, rich body, and not much carbonation. Definitely a sipper. It has a very port-like quality to it that comes through at the finish with sweet meaty dark fruits (raisin / fig), vanilla bean, a touch of sour cherries, a touch of mellow alcohol warmth (really nice considering the near 15% abv) and a rich chocolate and caramel. At the end of the finish a touch of pine bitter comes through, but is otherwise a very dessert themed chocolate and caramel mouth coating - it’s not heavy, but it does stick around. Lovely and elegant, I could see replacing any high end liquor with this one as a night cap ... I get the hype."

Really stunning aroma. Taste is a bit sweet, bit bitter, quite alcoholic. In fact a bit too alcoholic. Having quite some high alcohol beers today, some seem to be able to hide the alcohol while others do not as good. The aroma of this beer is absolutely phenomenal, but the taste cannot live up to that, mostly due to the unmasked alcohol. Still great stuff though."

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"(2, 4)",4.4,"[ Bottle ][ brokensail ][ 651ml ][ 10K+OT Tasting ][ Stemless Wine Taster ][ 5/3/14 ]

>> Inky pour, red highlights, low to no head. Nose is spicy cinnamon, low chili pepper, mild coconut. Fairly subtle with nice depth- certainly not explosive coconut or Mounds bar. Taste brings excellent toasted coconut, but the base beer underneath is not a superlative batch of BCBS. Rather it feels sweet and sticky with starching cherry candies. The highlight is the rye barrel, which brings some hot chili pepper heat/warming. Palate isn’t as silky as I’d like. Overall, fairly good but disappointing. Will retry in 6 months or so to see if the base can improve.

[ Bottle ][ 22oz ][ Trade ][ Pizza Boy Snifter ][ 11.27.14 ]

>> Ink pour with quickly dwindling red foam. Stains the glass with a swirl. Coconut oil rises to the top on the first glass poured, holy moly. Nose is fully integrated bourbon and coconut- there is soft rum raisin, black cherry, cherries jubilee, malaga gelato. Taste follows suit with a blend of some of my favor dessert flavors. Mouthfeel is super rich and oily, silky and soft as beer can be. Alcohol warmth is soft and integrated. This one really rocks with a year on it.

This is pretty enjoyable - nice and smooth notes of toasted caramel, notes of chocolate, light barrel. Easy to drink, no heat from this beer at all - much like it’s other barrel counterparts.

I have an unopened bottle waiting for me which is likely to be enjoyed before the end of the year, as I expect that the coconut will drop off within that time. Right now, this comes out with a fantastic viscosity and dense, decadent mouthfeel that is unlike any other imperial stout I have encountered. The aroma is heavy on coconut and cocoa with just a hint of spice from the Rye barrel aging. This series will be rotated/reinvented each year but for now enjoy this top level beer whilst you can."

Rich, gorgeous, viscous black pour with a small, bubbly tan head that dissipates quickly. Nose and flavor hold stunning coconut, vanilla, and almond sweetness that meld with classic Bourbon County that maintains and shows through beautifully despite the adjunct and barrel treatment. Despite the 5 months of age the coconut is present but not overwhelming; a true, masterful melding of a stupendous base beer with a well thought out and measured addition. Rich and big on the palate without a doubt, but not hot or unbalanced in the slightest. Gorgeously executed."

Aftertaste: lots of sugary coconut flavours, some milk and some dark chocolate, sugary sweetness, bit sour, very soft bitterness, more coconut. It’s like a liquid Bounty candy bar!

APPEARANCE: pitch black beer, no foam. Though some little coconut pieces in my glass!
NOSE: bourbon, alcohol, very sweet, little vanilla there.
TASTE: sweetness, bourbon, coconut is really clearly noticeable, it’s a strange thing. The bourbon county is a little ’easier to drink’, but still very good. Coconut adds to the flavor in general. Very faint peat at the end. Very nice, but not worth the hype maybe...

Pours dark brown, nearly black, with a small tan head and lots of little pieces of what I believe to be coconut floating all around. Nose is rich, but not as the almost cloyingly rich OG version of this wonderful stout. Coconut is super present, more in this beer than any other coconut or non-coconut beer I have ever had. Super impressive. Balance is incredible. Really good stuff, maybe my new favorite bourbon county, though the Rare was pretty incredible. Psyched to try this delicious elixir."

Body is of course full, mouthfeel syrupy and sticky, carbonation really low. Really good but I’d take the regular BCBS over this one any day of the week!"

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"(2, 70)",4.1,"Bottle (22 oz). Thanks to Rich and Frank who both sent me a bottle of this. Black with reddish reflects and a small quickly disappearing brown head. Aroma is quite complex with bourbon, roasted malt, roasted coconut, vanilla, wood, dark fruits, sweetness, chocolate and boozy notes. Taste is moderately sweet with a lot of Rye whisky, roasted coconut (a lot more than in the aroma), chocolate, vanilla, dark fruits, oak, roasted malt and light spiciness. Warming finish. Full bodied. Moderate carbonation. Oily and quite sticky mouthfeel. Very complex and definitely a world class RIS, but not in my top-3 from the BCS series and miles away from Rare. Nice coconut feature. Interesting."
Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"(2, 71)",4,"NOT A SHELF BEER





Solid Pour courtesy of saultbauls. 

Pours basically black with a small head that pretty much just goes away. 



The aroma has plenty of coconut, woodiness, sweetness and bourbon. The alcohol is noticeable but less so than in regular Bourbon County Stout of this age & there is a surprising bit of dark fruit shining through here. 



The flavor is very sweet, it’s got plenty of coconut flavor which works well here in a sort of coconut cookie a’la vanilla and evaporated milk kind of way. There is also a hefty bourbon and boozy element here, again with the surprising dark fruit flavors similar to the aroma. 



The palate is of course huge and mouth coating.



A really enjoyable take on an old favorite. 




AGAIN: NOT A SHELF BEER"

Your awesome bro!! Thanks again!!! Bottle shared with JohnGonk and Dan P. Pours jet black with zero head and some coconut floaties. Aroma of bourbon, oak, dark malts, rich bitter dark chocolate, and a hint of toasted coconut. Taste was much the same although lots of coconut came through in the finish as it warmed up. Aroma and taste was like drinking a Samoas Girl Scout cookie! Great stuff."
Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"(2, 73)",4.4,"22-oz. bottle shared with daknole and jpdurden24. Incredible aroma of chocolate, toasted coconut (but not too much), oak, medium whiskey, and a whisper of a vegetal tone. Pours dark brown with a few wispy bubbles and tiny pieces of coconut. Oh man, what a succulent taste of coconut, sweet dark chocolate, very boozy rye whiskey, and slight chili heat. Daknole said it best; it’s like a boozy, liquid Mounds bar. Slick mouthfeel; sweet hot finish. Just a divine brew."

Nose is strong, lots of bourbon and heat, some of the rich malt but no where near a regular bcs, with a little of the coconut in the nose. The taste is a little all over the place, lots of coconut in there with some of the rich maltiness of the bcs up front, coconut mid palate, lots of heat and bourbon towards the back and a ton if coconut lingers. Full bodied and moderate carbonation, a hint chalky in back."

Smells like a Mounds candy bar - coconut, toasted nuts and dark chocolate really stand out. Full-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and busy carbonation. The flavor presents sweet cafe con leche, dark chocolate and milk candy. Finishes burnt and sweet, like a camp-fire-charred marshmallow on a stick. Thanks to ctipping for supplying this world class beer!"
Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"(2, 77)",4.3,"Had several times out of the bottle and also on-tap.



Pours black, light tan-colored head, thin ring, wisps. Nose is smooth booze, light coconut which becomes more pronounced as it warms near room temp, chocolate, oak, burnt sugars. Taste is a perfect mix of bourbon, chocolate, and light coconut. Really depends on the bottle you get for the amount of coconut. Full body, creamy, rich, smooth finish.



An excellent beer, but I would say drink sooner rather than later because I’m sure the coconut won’t be around for too long."
Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"(2, 78)",4.7,"The beer appears like any other Bourbon County beer - deep black, viscous, small head that fades to nil. However, upon further inspection, I find tiny pieces of coconut floating on the surface. 

The aroma is fabulous. Bourbon, fudge, oak, roast, and all the character one expects from the standard Bourbon County. And then there’s the coconut. Wow. I really enjoy coconut / coconut desserts, so this beer is right up my alley.

The flavor is just phenomenal. An instant 5 rating for me. Coconut is front and center and just works beautifully in this beer. Like a chocolate macaroon. I haven’t had BCBS Rare in a while, but I do believe that this Proprietor’s variant is my favorite of the Bourbon County series. World class and well deserving of the high ratings."
Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"(2, 79)",4.1,"Big thanks to DocJ007 for sharing this one with us last night at our monthly tasting.




A - Pours pitch black with a nice one finger tall tan head, quickly dissipating down to a light film, leaving small trails of lace on the sides of the glass.




S - Smells of strong sugary sweetness, fudge brownie mix, coconut, molasses, dark fruits, charred wood and plenty of fusel alcohol. The coconut is there but as it warms up the intense sweetness holds it down.




T - Starts off with the intense sugary sweetness - mainly the chocolate, molasses and raw cane sugar - quickly being joined by the strong coconut flavor, dark fruits, charred wood and plenty of warming booze burn. Finish is still really sweet with some mild burn, lingering long after the finish.




M - Heavy body with moderate carbonation. Heavy, sweet feel makes it hard to consume more than a few ounces at a time.




O - A really nice coconut stout, but I have had better in my travels. If the sweetness could be dialed back a bit I think this one could be amazing, since that won’t be happening anytime soon this remains just a very nice coconut stout."

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"(2, 83)",4.8,"November 19, 2013, 1007. 22 oz bomber into a tulip glass. Looking down the neck of the beer you can see chunks of coconut. Man is that a great sign! Pours the regular BCBS pitch black with a fizzing dark mocha head. Head retention is pretty weak due to the unreal level of coconut bits and oil. It’s actually chunky and leaves trails of black stained coconut. It might not be pretty, but it’s one of the coolest effects I’ve seen in a beer. Aroma is chocolate, roasted malts, huge vanilla and butterscotch presence. In the back is the toasted coconut and a touch of rye spice. Liquid almond joy! The taste is even better. It has all the makings of regular BCBS; chocolate, roast, heavy vanilla and oak/bourbon but the sweetness is amplified with a super pleasant real coconut layer. Thick and coating mouth feel. Boozy finish with a lingering syrupy stickiness. This might just be the best variant to date, right up there with Vanilla. Where as the fruited variants tend to muddle the base beer, the coconut here only compliments the base beer. The rye barrel provide a nice little spice as well. Awesome, awesome, awesome beer and worthy of the hype!"
Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"(2, 84)",4.3,"Lovely beer that makes the perfect dessert. Creamy mouthfeel with a biding touch of alcohol. Long lasting sweet taste with a perfect twist between the sweetness of the cocobuts and the wooden impressions from the whisky barrels. Chocolate, vanilla and dried prunes. In the glass its all black with not much of a head. Heavy curtains with a sticky attitude.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"(2, 85)",3.7,"My Bottom Line:

Coconut thrives through this fun dessert of an Imperial Stout, swimming around chocolate and caramel flavours in an otherwise heavily sweet, complacent mouthfeel.



Further Personal Perceptions:

-There is no head of foam atop the darkness.

-The sweetness is prevalent and can get on your nerves quickly. Glad I got to split this bomber with a few likeminded aficionados.

-When the coconut subsides, this beer might reach better cohesion. For now, flavours are harmonious, but the flavour profile is not nearly as tight as it should be.

-The flatness and utter dominance of the coconut make this much less compelling than the ratings suggest.

Appearance: deep dark with slight burgundy hue on surface. No head. Poor lacing (may have been the glass here at The Publican). Taste: not terribly distinguishable from the 2013 coffee. The roasted coconut is imparting coffee like flavors. Perhaps the malts and their character attach to or draw out coffee like notes from the coconut? Who knows. Very rich chocolate flavor, though. Palate: creamy. Pairs fabulously with this blue cheese on the chef’s selection at Publican."

Aroma is of chocolate fudge, vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, brownies, and slight bourbon. Flavor is sweet at first, with notes much like the aroma, and transitions into a boozy oak finish. Coconut is not as present in the body, but it does a great job of balancing out the bourbon heat. Sweet, sticky, delicious."
Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013,"(2, 97)",4,"Bottle thanks to daknole. Aroma has a medium light coconut note but it is strong enough to break through the moderate chocolate notes and moderately strong bourbon notes. Some light oak and toasted almond character. Light roast character and faint dark fruit. Pours black with hints of dark brown. A faint attempt at a head appears but then disappears even quicker. Some white coconut flakes floating in the beer. No lacing and more a sheet of liquor than legs. Flavor has moderately strong chocolate notes with some light roast. Moderately strong bourbon character with lighter oak notes as well as some toasted almond and vanilla. Medium light coconut notes that add a hint of sweetness. Not much fruit esters. Medium alcohol spice in finish and moderate bitterness. Mouthfeel is full bodied with medium low carbonation. Oily, silky and chalky all at the same time. Low astringency and medium alcohol warmth. Overall the coconut flavor and aroma are great, but the appearance and mouthfeel are severely hurt by the coconut. A great coconut stout, but it is rough on the edges.

The pour on these TG stouts is crazy. Dark black, thick and viscous with a thin brown ring of head that dissipates without leaving a trace. The aroma is excellent. Chocolate, fudge, vanilla, heavy roast, a ton of molasses, light hints of dark fruits, tons of bourbon. It’s just as good as Assassin, but the flavor is where it separates itself. The molasses is huge. The chocolate and vanilla fudge are incredible. The thick roast and light charred oak balance incredibly. The booze is lighter than the nose and adds just a subtle offering.

Taste is faintly bitter up front, from the roast, but is dominantly sweet that lingeres. Faint alcohol burn in the throat, just as a feminiser that this isn’t kids stuff.

Toppling Goliath SR-71 Blackbird (2015 Bottling / Draft),"(1, 39)",4,"Bottle, shared by kind souls, in a location remote of my dining room. 

Pours pitch black with a small but well retained head. 



The aroma is a bit overly woody at first, but as it opens up it’s really got a nice chocolate & raisin thing going on. The light booze, big raisin, super rich and nicely woody thing remind me a lot of Pedro Ximénez, in fact blindfolded I might think this was PX going strictly on aroma. 



The flavor is big on woodiness and booze, but there are some nice toasted marshmallow, caramel, and vanilla things going on. As it warms it gets a little more fudge like and gets a nice little bit of raisin in there too. 



The mouthfeel is heavy, as it should be.... 


 
Enjoyable on all accounts, and really exceeding in my expectations for it."

A thick viscuous inky black pour from the bottle with sizable starkly chocolate dark head. A good layer dies down to a thicker film with good retention and lacing. Aromas are cocoa and earth, barrel and roast. Touches of vanilla, spirit and faint coconut intermix with caramel, biscuit and earth. Jabs of coffee, cocoa and deeper decadent sweetness come on. Lovely and rich. Initial is offers a firmer body, caramel and oak meet toffee, cocoa and roast. Coffee and espresso come on with jabs of vanilla, nice warming barrel that doesn’t interfere. Lushious, fudgey and a nice coffee element as we keep moving. The barrel is well integrated here, offering some mellow warmth, firmer vanillin and oak elements. The thick big body beneath is properly thinned, offering a complex mélange of rich flavors. Mocha, caramel, and fudge with a richer coffee element as we hit the backend. Great flow, flavor, good body and barrel ratio. Opened this with some friends who had indulged at Hunah Day in Tampa and said this was a completely different beer compared to the stuff they offered on tap in Florida, an offering at the time they thought was pretty lacking. So note for variance between those? Lovely stuff on par with the stouts I’m accustomed to from Toppling Goliath, perhaps even better than this last year’s Assassin. Great job here."

All of the beers have a good dose of silky smooth and rich sweetness, molasses and roasted barley malts in them. All of them are great beers.

Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"(1, 12)",4.5,"Finally - Beer #11 of my 10,00th Beer Milestone Celebration, and RATING #10,000 itself!!!!!
2017 Vintage Bottle (A Mounted Police Officer on the Horse)
Ridiculously dark brown coloured body, almost an oily black coloured body without much transparency at all (some at the edges when tilted) and a nice three centimetre tall rich light brown and deep tan head on top that stays afloat for a while and leaves a nice lace on the side as it fades. Aroma of very strong chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, oatmeal, molasses, alcohol and the strongest here - maple syrup (just as it should be) with a great finish of warm alcohol and sugars in the nose - very strong smelling, indeed. Full-bodied; Rich, super sweet and decadent maple syrup, woodsie, bourbon and roasted malt notes dominate up front with a lot of residual sugars from pitted fruits, molasses and toffee with a pungent malt backbone that really brings out the oats and grainy notes with some slight nutty and woodsie flavours, but the roasted oatmeal and rich coffee notes really penetrate the sugars here with a nice balance to bring out the strong sugars at the end and some alcohol warmth at the finale to make this FEEL nice as well. Aftertaste is super potent and rich a lot of alcohol, a ton of roasted malts and oatmeal here, but the pitted fruits, cream, coffee, molasses and especially maple syrup sweetness notes are the strongest on the end, which they should be for the style and for how long this has been aged. Overall, a great beer of course and one that should be sampled if you can get your hands on it (it seems much easier than when I bought this one originally [this is my original bottle, but I have many in my cellar right now] from the store) and especially to buy a couple and age some of them for a longer period of time (in optimal conditions, of course), as I have another bottle from this same purchase that I might have in another 5 or 10 years on a special occasion. Great to sample of course and as a Michigander and as someone who loves real Maple Syrup, this was only fitting to have as my BEER #10,000 and for such a special occasion after aging it for almost six years myself. Great to sample and while I like writing so much for each beer, this one finally ushers in a change for me to simplify my ratings entirely and post much less 'wordie' ratings and verbose typings as I have been doing for my FIRST 10,000! I sampled this 75 cL bottle as Beer #11 (BEER #10000 itself!) [of 21 - 10 (for 10,000) of Each side of the 10,000 Beer Milestone and the 10,000th itself!] of my 10,000th Beer Milestone, purchased from The Food Emporium (randomly was able to find this crazy hard-to-find (at the time) stash in New York, New York on 02-December-2017 for US$35,99 (I didn't care how much it was at the time - I was so happy that I found it in the first place!), bottled in 2017 and sampled at my house here in Washington on 17-May-2023."

OCCASION: having just posted my father's obituary while three feet of snow fall, I feel the night deserves something aged a few years... GLASSWARE: Lindemans stemmed tulip... pours a viscous jet black body that rolls out a a number of upward-cascading rivulets of effervescence... its head continues the show, stabilized as a thick half-finger's worth of light tan, creamy foam approximating a latte's froth... rich vanilla, maple syrup, mellow bourbon sweetness, a hint of smoke, some alcoholic heat... then heavy coffee bean and roasted malts arrive, and the profile is quite a celebration.... the first sip is frothy at the start, turning to velvet-smooth satin past the tongue and a warm entrancing finish that fires well after... the teeth pulse--the hops are in here--and the mouth holds its presence... the alcohol draws in and around, but like the best, it isn't tasted, but rather, appreciated... rich is the word--each sip is a dessert in itself, a settling, centering mood boost that makes one appreciate.... a massive collision of syrup and coffee initially arrest with intensity, before the sweet bourbon, charcoal smokiness, chocolate, and lactic acids round the experience into a drink worth mulling over... I especially like how they ignored the bacon temptation--this works so well featuring the original KBS with a worthwhile variation... it's a compliment this urges me to finish and pour a dram of the Jack Daniels Barrel Select I bought a while back, thought that introduces banana--eh, another story for another time... speaking of stories: I had a bomber waiting to be consumed on my forty-second birthday while staying with my in-laws in between houses, and my son unwittingly smashed it while opening the refrigerator...the dog loved it, but we all cried a bit. Fortunately, CBS returned not long after, and maybe it's better I drink it in 12oz. offerings... well, this was worth waiting for, and though it could be straight shot if only for its ABV, its sweetness makes each sip require a caesura before its next one..."

Light caramel, smoky creamy cocoa, a little wood and maple leafiness, giving suggestions of apple skin, and a little porridge oat base. Superb aroma, with rich notes harmonising flawlessly. Lowish carbonation, rich velvet texture with decent dryness in the finish. Again, judged perfectly. Flavours are lightly woody, a little smoke, some leafy apple from the maple syrup, mellow caramel not dominating, a little oat and lots of rich cocoa coming through in the aftertaste. Some 'top' beers are overrated - this isn't one of them. Luxury craft beer par excellence, rich flavours perfectly integrated. Stonking ABV gives no more than a nice warmth.

Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"(1, 59)",4.2,"Black color with a modest brown head. Aromas start with the bourbon, though it is fairly subdued, at least in comparison with her sister KBS. There are clear maple aromas, but again not so strong. Mellow aromas of maple and red soft fruits. Plum, cocoa aromas are apparent, also coffee but again little less than KBS. Taste is a nice mix by sweet and bitter. The vanilla and maple provide a mellowness that balance out any original bitterness of the KBS, so the beer is more balanced and less rough. The body is full, there's a distinct alcohol warmness. The texture is a bit creamy, more so than KBS, thanx to the impact of the maple and vanilla from the oak barrels and the maple syrup. A great beer but I prefer the KBS's strongness than this wonderful ""soft"" maple syrup version."

Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"(1, 76)",4.4,"Draught @ Fox & Hounds, Sønderborg, on Øllets Dag 2020. Pours cloudy very dark brown with stable dark tan head. Clear aroma of coffee, yeast, chocolate and malt, with touches of dried fruit. Bitter, roasty and coffeelike flavour with notes of barrel, lactose and chocolate, and touches of yeast, malt and hints of hops. Bitter aftertaste of alcohol and roast, with malty notes. Delicious, if heady."
Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"(1, 77)",3.3,"This is for founders CBS “imperial stout with chocolate and coffee aged and maple syrup bourbon barrels.” This is the closest beer I could find so I am putting my review here. Pours almost black. Thin tan head. I was somewhat disappointed in this as I had had the breakfast stout and the KBS and enjoyed both of those. Strong notes of coffee and chocolate. Very lightly hopped. Light to moderate carbonation. A good brew but it was just too sweet for me

Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"(1, 78)",4.4,"Аромат не сильный но весьма ощутимый при этом сложный. Прежед всего много зерен от какао и кофе, бочка есть но не так много, приятный шоколад, что то между черным и Бельгийским, есть нотки от сиропа, но чутка. Цвет черный, немного маслянистый по структуре, пенка на удивление очень неплохая, мелкопузырчатая, кофейная, но не очень стойкая. Вкус по началу просто хороший и не более, также много зерен от како, снова меньше кофе но больше шоколада с ванильными нотами. Но уже после полного согревания пива имеются приятные бархатистые нотки от солода и бочки которые не на йоту не выдают алкоголя или чего то еще противного. Послевкусие крутое и сложное, уже гораздо больше ноток от бочки и сладких карамельных ноток бурбона, также почти в первый раз проявляет себя вкус сиропа, хотя его резкости все равно немного не хватает. В целом очень сбалансированный стаут, я осознал почему этот пивас такой крутой, хотя лучше ли он чем топовые пастри стауты? Это хороший вопрос."

Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"(1, 80)",4.9,"Costaud...très costaud, ce Canadian Breakfast Stout, qui intègre chocolat, café, sirop d'érable dans sa recette et qui est vieilli en fût de bourbon. Les bières présentant de fortes intensités aromatiques et une forte présence en bouche demandent un équilibre sans faille pour être réussies. Et c'est ici le cas avec un alcool chaleureux et puissant, tout en restant souple, avec un sucre bien présent sans l'être de trop, et des arômes de café, chocolat, sirop d'érable bourbon avec de légères épices de toute beauté. Très belle maîtrise. En verre nous sommes sur un noir total avec une fine mousse brune. Le nez est sur le café et le bourbon en dominante avec en complément chocolat, sirop d'érable et de légères épices. A la dégustation, ça envoie dès L'attaque, avec un alcool chaleureux et punchy sans être trop chargé pour un ensemble qui reste raffiné. Superbe seconde bouche à la fois soyeuse et racée. L’arrière-bouche, où le duo café et bourbon est dominant, est punchy avec beaucoup de tempérament. Le final, long et sobre finit la dégustation de façon très élégante. On sent de l'expérience derrière cet Imperial stout de très bonne facture."

Ależ jest tu prawdziwa inwazja kawy i czekolady na kubki smakowe. Bardzo słodkie w sumie, choć jest tu kontra w postaci gorzkiej kawy i czekolady.
Odczucie: pijałem gęstsze i pełniejsze, chyba lekko alkohol piecze w język, gładkie, gorzka czekolada i kawa na finiszu.
Całość: bardzo dobre, słodkie, złożone i intensywne piwo ale moim zdaniem nie zasługuje na aż tak wysoką notę, bo po pierwsze ciało, po drugie beczka, po trzecie za słodkie.

The mouthfeel and the taste of this beer are the crown jewels.  It's one of the most pleasant stouts available on the market, if you are lucky enough to find one.  The aging process in barrels that had stored both whiskey and syrup makes for one of the most unique flavors ever achieved in a stout."

Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"(2, 41)",4.1,"A rather expensive bottle found in Guadeloupe, but what the hey, this thing is hyped and I'm on vacation. Poured slightly chilled it has okay dark beige foam and brownish black body. Smells of deep and heavy maple and coffee, the coffee takes centre stage but the maple helps immensely to tone it down a bit. Some vague wood notes and coffee liqueur is showing. Taste is deep syrupy coffee liqueur in a good way, maple is helping to smooth and balance everything out. Mouthfeel is  smooth and chewy, warming, the alcohol is nowhere to be seen, I'm not sure how it could get better than this. Nonetheless this is very good, heavy but extremely balanced. It also works very well with the 22 month aged comté cheese I somehow found here in Guadeloupe."

Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"(2, 44)",4.2,Pour is a thick black with a small tan head that goes away quickly.  Flavor is nice whiskey barrel with maple syrup and tons of coconut.  Flavor is more barrel notes with a nice roast with a little sweet maple syrup with just a ever so slight alcohol note. Not as thick of a mouthfeel as I thought it would have but it still has a nice chewy malt.  Hard to find fault with this beer.  Plenty of barrel and maple syrup notes without being overly heavy or boozy.

Very smooth and enjoyed them more than their KBS which is my go to beer.  I was looking forward to 4 pack 12 ounce bottles when became available last week.  However I was disappointed.  I am not sure if they changed something in the brewing process or if it needs to age in the bottle more.  Anyone else have a similar experience?

The stout poured an opaque black color with a tan head and ample lacing. Wonderful aroma of maple syrup and roasted malts. The flavors are mind-blowing, maple syrup, chocolate, roasted malts and hints of chocolate.  Very SMOOTH.  The stout is on the sweet side of beers, but so much is going on.  Medium body and soft carbonation.  You can detect some coffee after each swallow, what a complex beverage."
Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"(2, 76)",4.2,"Four-pack of 12oz bottles for about $25 total, these Bottled On: 09.17.19, featuring 11.3% abv.  Nose rich chocolate, coffee, maple syrup; the Bourbon barrel character is there but weaker than, say, Underground Mountain, and has absolutely no alcohol burn/sting/component in the nose -- surprising and unexpected.  Pour deep brown resolving to opaque motor oil, head sudsy and surpasses tan into light chocolate; dense and foamy with some mild lace but not really legs.  Taste very strongly sweet with low bitterness, heavy chocolate and coffee, and oh yes!  there comes the alcohol!  Controlled, though, and not extreme at all, just a little singe and smooth warming that surges and lasts, quite pleasant, actually.  Full body lightly oily, mild astringency of the good kind, just a hint of hazelnut, crema/espresso, grape, red berry, a blush of melanoidin, heavy maple sugar, but never cloying.  The barrel character really is surprisingly low, just a little wood around the teeth in the long aftertaste, but all the classier for it.  Some flavor synergy.  This is a variant on an extremely accomplished beer, not sure that it unquestionably improves on the original, but it's magnificent on its own.  [2019.11.13: 4.2]"

Still good and all but it wasn't really anything more than most BA stouts I've had and in all honesty, didn't crack my Top 10 for the category, let alone my personal all-time Top 10. Oh well. At least I can check it off the list. And it did suit the January like single digit weather here on... Veteran's Day. Gonna be a long ass winter."
Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"(2, 80)",4.3,"Pours dark and thick as one would expect.  Not jet black depth like a couple of imperial stouts but darker than average for sure.  Head looks like a piece of granite - it is firm and isn't going anywhere.  Even the large bubbles are just sitting there like they are lodged in a glacier.  Aroma of slightly sweet burden and charred wood.  Lots of chocolate, maple syrup and coffee in this beer, and powerful smooth malts to boot.  I'm not sure how the aroma is so tame with this much flavor.  Strong and complete without being overpowering.  Despite the name, if you have this for breakfast you are going to be pretty tuned up.  Yummy beer nonetheless."
Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"(2, 81)",4.6,"The beer was purchased in a four pack of 12 oz bottles. Dark brown body had ruby highlights when held up against light. The head was brown, and one finger thick. The beer was lightly carbonated, and the head disappeared shortly after pouring. The aroma was rich, with coffee beans, toffee, and chocolate being the predominant smells. The taste had an incredible depth to it, as the flavors of vanilla, maple syrup, coffee, chocolate, cinnamon, and caramel were in perfect harmony. The alcohol content was generously warm. This was definitely a slow sipper, as the sweet aftertaste lingered on and on after swallowing. The body was thick, rich, and coated every corner of the mouth. So glad to have finally found it on the shelves locally. The cost is pretty high at around $24 a four pack, but when you want the best, you have to pay."

Clear, I think, dark, viscous, no head. Magenta/maroon highlights.
Nose is pretty nicely homogenized. No single adjunct jumps out at you and the cinnamon doesn't seem overdone. Dense, chocolatey malts with some dryness interjected by both spicy chili and light barrel. No booze. Surprisingly tame and mellow.
In the mouth it fares similar. Surprisingly mellow all around. Some bourbon but not quite as much barrel character as I'd like, or have gotten used to having from so much Side Project. Humble brags aside, it's mellow, flavorful, not boozey or sugary. Well done."

Taste: very thick, lots of barrels, very complex cinnamon. When it's warming up you can find nice black chocolate notes. I couldn't really find any vanilla.
Overall: for sure - this is a nicely done imperial stout, but you can't really find much over the cinnamon and chillies here. Not that they are overpowering here, no, they are nicely balanced, but the rest is quite weak. Some black chocolate here, yes, for sure, but no vanilla here for me. A bit disappointed considering the price tag. I would better have 3-4 bottles of the Counterpart Deciduous, than this one at this crazy price."

Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"(1, 17)",4,"Bottle, ‘20 vintage. Black, soy sauce in color, maybe a reddish brown tint... Low carbonation.... Aroma of ancho chilies, peppers, not much cinnamon on nose, whiskey barrel... Mouthfeel is a lot thinner than I expected, pepper is fairly prominent, rye spices, light chili notes on palate... more vegetal than cinnamon... Not as good as I hoped, but still very tasty

Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"(1, 31)",4.2,"Pours a pitch black coloration with a small, creamy head. Smell is dominated by rich chocolate fudge and an intense cinnamon note, as well as a strong earthy, oaky, peppery rye barrel note and hints of vanilla and chili. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by chocolate fudge, cinnamon and and a fantastic rye barrel character of earthy, musty, oaky, peppery notes, as well as lighter notes of roasted malt, vanilla, chili peppers and just a hint of dark fruits. Finishes with a light sweetness and some cinnamon and oaky, spicy notes lingering in the aftertaste. Full, creamy mouthfeel with a rich body and low carbonation. The cinnamon and chili work really well with the peppery, spicy rye barrel character, although I have to say that the cinnamon presence is way overdone here for my personal taste and that there is also not quite enough of a bitter/roasty counterpoint to the sweeter chocolate and vanilla notes. Considering the ridiculous secondary market value of this, I'd honestly rather have Bomb!."

The flavor follows suit with notes of the dark chocolate, cinnamon, and chili pepper spices right up front followed by the dark roasted malts and smooth bourbon oak to balance things out while some spicy rye ties it all together. Not overly spiced or too much heat from the chili peppers which is nice. Everything is very well balanced. Full bodied and smooth with soft carbonation that leads to a dark chocolate, cinnamon, and spicy rye with whiskey soaked oak on the finish with soft lingering chili pepper spice long after the finish.

Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"(1, 77)",4.9,"Perennial's most highly acclaimed product, a rye whisky barrel aged edition of the classic Abraxas - finally able to taste this quite famous beer at BCBF (and I was not the only one interested, considering the long queue of beer geeks lining up when this one was opened...). Thin, moussy, deep brownish-tinged bead head, opening middle but stable in the form of a ring, over a black beer with deep bronze-ish brown edges. Overwhelming, incredibly rich bouquet of Christmas cake, gingerbread including a lot of soft spicy cinnamon, hot chocolate sauce and chocolate liqueur, nutmeg, vanilla-ish bourbon and oak, fudge, brownies, rum, liquorice, fresh cloves, juniper leaves, 'kruidenkoeken' en 'pepernoten' galore. Sweet onset, brown sugariness thickly coating hints of dates and raisins, noble and very concentrated, soft carbo, very thick and greasy mouthfeel. Profoundly deep 'chocolateness' and toffeeish malt goodness ensues, deeply and elegantly nutty, like a mixture of liquid chocolate bars and liquid gingerbread. This huge and decadently delicious pile of malts is brightened by soft woody tannins, vanilla-ish oak and bourbon colours, all on top of the familiar sweet and almost 'Christmassy' ethereal cinnamon and vanilla bean flavours. The chili heat, like in the regular version, accentuates a warming, obviously very bourbon-like alcohol effect without becoming too obtrusive. This is a majestic, caleidoscopic, awe-inspiring masterpiece of a stout - I had already fallen in love with the regular one, but this one is even better, and exceeds my highest expectations. One of the very best stouts I ever had the honour to taste, regardless of hype; I do not see how any stout can get any better than this so after a moment of doubt and comparing it with other top class stouts I had so far, I have no other choice but to give this perfect beauty a near perfect score..."

The pour is a lighter black with a thin ring of dark tan head and a couple spots of lace. The aroma is pretty good. There is a strong spiciness from the chilies and cinnamon, but the chocolate really mutes it. The barrel offers a further balance and a hint of vanilla. The light woodiness really adds a touch of sweetness that I like. The flavor is just as good. The complexity and depth really stand out. Chilies, cinnamon, chocolate, light vanilla, whiskey sweetness, and a light woodiness. This is just so complex and lovely. The mouth feel is light and not as viscous as I’d want.

Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"(1, 94)",4.1,"Tap at Snallyghaster 2016 showing pitch black with quickly dissipating latte colored foam. 

The nose shows notes of vanilla and molasses. Upon warming up, a clear coconut profile comes out. 

The palate is full bodied and syrup slick showing barely any carbonation. Vanilla and clean coconut notes ring throughout the beer with the attack beginning with a mix of light chocolate, cinnamon, and tobacco. A very strong cinnamon spiciness begins on the front end. The mid palate shows intense coconut with a finish on light tobacco and burnt notes. Not bad at all, but I fully prefer the non-barrel aged version."
Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"(1, 95)",4.8,"This is just so much better than regular Abraxas in every aspect. Not too much herb, much more cinnamon forward, thick mouthfeel, full body, crazy taste overall. Extremely complex beer. Rye whiskey barrel tastes fantastic!"
Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"(1, 96)",4.1,"Pours an opaque black from the bottle, motor oil thick with thin ring of bubbly tan brown head. Aroma of big barrel notes over hints of spice and roast. Taste follows, chilies are subdued a bit by the barrel, big sweetness all over it, not sure the vanilla beans were necessary for the barrel version. Thick and viscous, a bit of warming booze, but not too bad. A really solid barrel aged stout."
Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"(1, 97)",4,"Bottle at the End of an Era tasting at ABC Beers, Den Haag. Poured an oily dark brown with little life. The aroma is sweet malt, coconut, cinnamon, dark chocolate. The flavour is moderate to strong sweet with a rich malt, molasses, alcohol bitter, coffee, light vanilla, spicy chocolate palate. Full bodied with flat carbonation."

No head or carbonation. lear black pour. Vanilla spiciness and chocolate. Very good"
Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"(1, 99)",4.8,"This barrel aged example is one of the best stouts made today. The aroma smells like chocolate, chili and cinnamon. It has a dark appearance but not as black as many of the stouts. The taste is quite amazing with hints of the chillis, the cacao nibs, vanilla with that slightly spicy aftertaste. The Rye barrels fit it perfectly and the 11% is disguised quite well. Look forward to trying again soon. Cheers!"
Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"(1, 100)",4.1,"Pitch black and completely opaque without even a trace of lighter color. Half finger dark mocha head that quickly settles into a thin ring. Minimal spotty lacing left behind. Nice color but has poor retention. Foam head fades and there’s not much in the way of lacing. 

The nose on this beer is really incredible. Excellent barrel character that doesn’t completely overpower the complex malt bill of the base. Perfectly integrated. A touch of damp oak and subtle toothpick but not too strong of a wood flavor. Really nice spirit with spicy whiskey/boozy bourbon flavor. Barrel also gives off a lot of vanilla bean, toasted coconut and gooey marshmallow. Underneath, there is a very nice blend of roasted and sweet, desert-like malts. Subtle roast but not overpowering with some coffee bean, burnt toast, smoke, oatmeal and bitter dark chocolate. This is countered by silky chocolate-like sweetness, caramel, milk chocolate, lactic cream, fudge and molasses. This beer smells crazy good. 

Full body with oily viscosity and a blast of boozy heat that lingers over the other barrel notes and complex malts into a dry, hot finish. Lots of alcohol flavor and the ABV isnt very well masked. spicy rye whiskey along with dry oak/toothpick. Barrel isn’t as complex as in the nose. Spirit is really strong and it has a stronger wood flavor than I prefer. Some subtle vanilla/coconut sweetness. Malts flavors are still lingering underneath but they are blasted and overwhelmed by the heat/whiskey. Stronger roasted malt presence than expected with burnt sugary sweetness. Deeply roasted robust espresso/coffee flavor along with smoke, burnt wood, charred toast and bitter dark cocoa. As the palate adjusts the sweet fudge/baker’s chocolate notes start to show. Pretty good but isn’t as complex as expected. The chile spiciness and cinnamon show up after it warms but the palate needs to adjust to the overwhelming whiskey and heat. Smells great but it’s really hot and boozy and the malt bill is overly charred/roasted. Decent but kind of underwhelming considering the fanfare."

Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"(2, 7)",3.2,From a shared bomber in a snifter at Binny’s tasting room. Intense chocolate aroma. Flavor is intensely spicy with cinnamon dominating the palate. finish is clean but slightly astringent. Not a drainpour obviously but I don’t understand the hype. This beer is very unbalanced and overspiced. The Barrel aging may help mellow it but doesn’t ad any flavor. Overkill beer.
Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"(2, 8)",4.5,"750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Inky black. Glass staining. Nice khaki head. Wispy on the surface with a thick collar. Great aroma. Lots of cinnamon. Peppers, vanilla, and chocolate. Not a lot of barrel character from it. Peanut buttery. Pepper flavor comes through in the background throughout. Peanut butter flavor persists throughout too. Lots of chocolate and a bucket of cinnamon. Some whiskey and vanilla comes through, but not much. Chewy and slick. Very nice body. Peppers cut the heaviness.
Pains me to say this is just as good as Hunahpu. I wish there was more barrel, but it’s hella good."
Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"(2, 9)",4.5,"750-ml 2014 bottle. The spices (red chiles, cinnamon, black pepper, and cumin) dominate the nose but a good amount of chocolate and whiskey manage to shine through the heat, followed by some anise. Glossy obsidian in color with a filmy mocha head. My goodness, what a sublime taste. Flavors of milk chocolate, incredibly smooth whiskey, a touch of oak woodiness, only moderate spiciness despite the hot nose, a hint of caramelized sugar, solid vanilla, and charred malt all dance on the tongue. Spicy, dry finish. Just freaking amazing."
Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"(2, 10)",4.5,"Une dégustation chez Jool. Sensiblement la même robe que sa grande sœur (ou sa petite, c’est selon). Au nez, bourbon caramélisé assez sexy. Intégration parfaite de la vanille et des éléments épicés. Parfums pralinés. Pâte de noix sucrées. Notes de tabac à pipe. Coco grillée. Friandise chocolatée. Complexe et décadent. Au goût, une explosion de caramel poivré, de cacao noir, de noix de coco, de beurre d’arachides, de brioche à la cannelle, de tabac, de whiskey épicé et de malts rôtis. Opulent, généreux, luxueux, satisfaisant. En bouche, le corps qui est lourd ne sature jamais mon palais. La texture est riche, liquoreuse, si plaisante et différente de ce que j’ai pu voir dans la version dite «normale». En finale, le chocolat, le caramel et le bourbon enveloppent la cannelle et le piment ancho. Impérial stout supérieur. Fantatisco. Fucking awesome."

Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"(2, 22)",4.6,"Thanks to Matt and Kevin, shared with my family on Christmas Eve.

Pours a viscous black color, with a small, fluffy, dark brown head, leaving back a perfect, thin lacing at the side of the glass.

Smells of sweetened cinnamon on top of earthy malts, bakers chocolate and a gentle amount of coffee. The Bourbon qualities aren’t too present on their own, but blend very well into the chili spices, adding heat and wood to the nose. Notes of molasses provide a sweetness to the brew, which gets supported by the omnipresent cinnamon spiciness outstandingly well. 

Begins with rich cinnamon flavors straight from the beginning, while earthy, toasted malts, as well as slightly bitter coffee build the foundation of this beer. The cinnamon gets a bit sticky and dusty, while it turns pretty intense on the palate, with molasses and toffee adding a lot of sweetness to its dominant spiciness. The Bourbon barrel, mirroring the nose, doesn’t turn very present on its own, while it interacts perfectly well with the chilies, leaving the spicy cinnamon with an interesting, hot and complex touch on the palate. The sweetness gets balanced by a wooden Bourbon bite, which got a semi dry, bitter aspect to it, highlighting the earthy malts. 

Finishes with a sublte, spicy burn, while coffee becomes more present, still with a slick sweetness detectable, which is now calmed by the wooden maltiness, while the Bourbon shines through in its wooden, vanilla qualities, with a peppery bite. Has an incredible smooth mouthfeel, with a hot burn in the end. The beers body is incredible full and quite different to the normal version, while providing less coffee, way more cinnamon and the proper sweetness."

Aroma of CINNAAAMOON, cinnamon rolls, dark ripe fruits, some spice (from the chili i guess), cocoa powder, brown sugar, cookie dough, some barrel character, vanilla and some weak coconut as it warms - but the main thing is really cinnamon rolls all over the place. This beer gotta be kidding me. The taste is just freakingly slick chocolate, raw cocoa, vanilla, chili, cinnamon rolls, dark fruits, nougat and a lot of wooden whiskey barrel character. I think the barrel and the chili saves this beer from being cloying. The end of this beer is just crazy good just covering your mouth with melted chocolate haha!

Incredible aroma of sweet chocolate and cinnamon, spicy rye whiskey, very very faint peppers, vanilla, roasted marshmallows. It’s like cinnamon s’mores with whiskey, though the whiskey supports rather than overpowers the smell. Flavor follows with awesome cocoa powder and cinnamon, vanilla whiskey notes, ever so slight spice and warmth that lingers from a combination of the peppers and the alcohol. Thick and viscous, though not syrupy, low carbonation but enough bubbles to keep things thick, and very rich with a slightly roasty dry finish.

The pour was a dark brown, near black...fairly opaque and had a small mocha-brown head. Nice aromas of cocoa, pepper spice, vanilla with a mild oak and alcohol. Taste is nicely balanced as you would expect from the nose. Nothing is jumping out and dominating the palate, but each ingredient makes it;s presence known. Nice cocoa and vanilla sweetness that cuts the pepper heat and barrel character nicely. Just wishing it was a bit more ""bold"" in terms of body and character. Typical gluttonous expectations. Finishes a bit ""hot"", but fairly balanced. I get more of the sweetness in the back end where I was hoping for some dry cocoa to harmonize with the alcohol.

Warm cinnamon Teddy Graham crackers, sweet vanilla cake, snickerdoodle cookies, brown sugar, light fudge drizzle, & a mild sense of bourbon soaked wood chips hanging around just outside the periphery... So smooth, so complex & unique.

Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"(2, 87)",4,"Sampled along the RBSG 2014 bus tour. Bottle at the brewery. Nose has a lot of booze in it, and the strong cinnamon from the base beer is still present. Taste is like a chocolate cinnamon bourbon ball. Slightly sweet and borders on being too thick and sweet, but ultimately dries out. I never seem to get the pepper character in the base beer and this version is the same way. Very good beer though."
Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"(2, 88)",2.9,This stuff smells great but is ultimately a one trick pony. It smells and tastes like Mexican hot chocolate with a shot of whiskey in it. It is black w/ only a small head of brown foam. I get a bunch of cinnamon and vanilla and all kinds of good stuff in the nose and can say it smells legitimately delicious but tasting it is when it sort of goes awry. It is heavy and sweet and the spices and booze overwhelm any real malt character. It has very little carbonation which increases the ponderous heavy feeling of it and overall it feels more like some sort of spicy version of Kahlua than a good beer to me.
Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"(2, 89)",4.8,"Bottle @ Perennial during RBSG. Holy fucking shit, this beer is a trip. Black appearance with a lasting dark brown head. Not a ton of whiskey in the nose but the other ingredients are super potent. Cinnamon, brownie batter, rich dark chocolate, some roast, and coconut in the nose. The flavor is incredible. Not hot or sugary. Tons of brownies, chocolate cake, light whiskey, fairly spicy, cinnamon and nutmeg flavor. Some spices and spiciness in the after taste. The barrel character isn’t that overwhelming but I still seemed to enjoy this one a bit better than the normal version."
Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"(2, 90)",2,"Really wanted to like this one, but the cinnamon overwhelmed me. Lots (perhaps too many) flavors battling in this beer, but the cinnamon beat them all into submission. I will try again, as it may have been a bad night for my palette...

A: Black with a thin mocha head. Nice legs. 

N: Big cocoa, cinnamon, pepper. Vanilla, molasses and quick bread. Black peppercorn.

T: Spicy with some sweetness. 

M: Thick, sticky, with a light touch of carbonation to keep it off the tongue. 

O: A big tasty beer. The cinnamon does well in this one, though, like its brother, it is pretty spicy. I like Mexican Wedding cake in the pepper stout category, but bourbon barreling Abraxas makes it a cut above."
Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"(2, 92)",4.4,"Bottle at a recent RB tasting... Holy cow! Poured jet black with a thin forming, brown head. Aroma of whiskey barrels with cinnamon and chocolate. Very mole’-esq in both aroma and flavor. Thick mouthfeel, cinnamon shined with a hint of chili pepper heat and boozy alcohol to make things interesting. Toasted grains with some roast.  Could grab the vanilla too, but was definitely hidden in the depths of this complex beer. Simple phenomenal."

Very intense coconut and tropical aromas with Mexican mole behind it, slitghly nutty. Chilies apparent as piquancy once it hits the tongue. A substantial, thick body despite the size and age.

Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"(2, 99)",4.5,"BBT3 tasting. Poured a black color with an off white head. Did not know what to expect going into this one as chilies and cinnamon are kind of a turn off for me. Cinnamon was definitely there, but if cinnamon were to be done in a beer, this is the way to do it. Chilies there too, but not an overpowering chili. Whiskey, woody, chocolate, vanilla, and caramel. This one was just done right all the way around."

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 3)",5,"Well, here we are then: one of the biggest whales from Belgium, the legendary start of Dolle's Special Reserva editions and therefore the very first beer in Belgium to have been deliberately aged on wooden casks which previously contained another beverage, red Bordeaux wine in this case. The pioneering role of Dolle Brouwers cannot be underestimated, in being the first non-family-owned craft brewery in Belgium (around 1980, the same time as the beginnings of Abbaye des Rocs' brewing activities); then in 2000, this Special Reserva series, which is continued to this day and has been applied not only to Stille Nacht but also to Oerbier and on one occasion to Dulle Teve (of which a new one is in the process of preproduction now), marks the beginning, at least in Belgium, of what is now common practice among craft breweries around the world. The brewer, Kris, was generous enough to offer us a vertical tasting of all Stille Nacht Special Reserva editions yesterday and needless to say, I cannot thank him enough for his kind generosity - I did have a few Stille Nacht Special Reserva editions before, but never this legend, the ultimate one, a whale I never thought I would ever be able to taste. Carefully opened by Kris himself, the 17 year-old 75 cl bottle, with rusty crown cap and charmingly moldy and partially disintegrated label, did effectively - and contrary to my expectations - produce a minimal head upon pouring, in the form of a thin ring of eggshell-white, loosely knit bubbles, which expectedly disappeared shortly thereafter; the beer itself was of a most beautiful and intense, almost glowing orange-amber colour with a molten copper-like hue, clear initially but hazy with sediment near the finishing of the bottle. A milky cloud of dead yeast and proteins appeared only in the very end. The aroma was of an unbelievable complexity, depth and beauty - I cannot recall ever having sniffed any barleywine (because that is basically, though perhaps unintentionally, what were are talking about here) that comes close to this: gooseberry jam, candied orange peel and marmelade, beguiling vanilla-ish wet oak wood, sweet white dessert wine, honey liqueur, armagnac, matured sweet sherry, old cider, amaretto, marzipan, fresh fig juice, moist raisin bread and, as a sign of its respectable age, hints of wet cardboard and damp cellar, only adding charm, maturity and complexity. The onset was sweet, lush and almost 'praline'-like, hinting at candied figs, sugared fried apples and sweet raspberry jam, drenched in an orangey marmelade sauce with a light sourish sherry hint, that stretches towards the finish where it becomes more outspoken - though a kaleidoscopic, utterly refined and ravishingly beautiful candied sweetness remains the main flavour. Carbonation is evidently very soft (but not at all flat!), resulting in a thick, very vinous, almost syrupy mouthfeel. Thick layers of caramelly and slightly cookie-like malt sweetness with honey and marmelade sweetness on top blend with an unbelievably deep and rich finish, where sweet dessert wine flavours (rather than actual Bordeaux, strangely) are added, tannic woodiness renders a gently drying effect and very sherry-like oxidation, of the noblest kind I may ever have encountered in any vintage beer, establishes a deeply elegant and luscious maturity. Vanilla-, marmelade-, marzipan- and cognac-like impressions make this almost like a liquid crêpe Suzette - with yeasty breadiness added in the very end, soaked in brandy-like alcohol warmth. This is, along with some of the greatest lambics, the most impressive Belgian beer I ever tasted - I feel humbled by this, and not just because of its legendary status in the craft beer world. It is hard to describe, even for me, how beautiful, opulent, deep and aristocratic this beer is; this is without any doubt at the very top of what beer can do in a gastronomical sense, so I cannot but give this the perfect score - if this doesn't deserve that, then I don't know what does. What makes it all the more remarkable, is that it has remained in such mint condition after seventeen years - this only adds to the fact that this product was made and cared for with utmost knowledge, skill and experience. My deepest gratitude goes out to Kris, not only for being so immensely generous to offer this and other bottles for our tasting session, but for giving a beer as utterly beautiful as this to the world. A whole string of young craft breweries today, in Belgium but also on an international level, can and should learn from this. A day to never forget!"

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 24)",4.5,"10th September 2011
Cloudy orange - brown beer. Decent sized white head. Nose reminds me very much of a Vintage Port cork that has just been pulled. Palate is soft and semi dry and quite well carbonated. Mild caramel malt backbone, tasting slightly aged. Riding over all this are rich wine notes. Red wine with strawberry and then later on blackberry and blackcurrant. Agitating the beer produces some lactose on the nose. Aniseed becomes more obvious. There is a surprising amount of carbonation here and much agitation is required to remove it! The finish is dry and woody. This is the most Port like beer I’ve ever had. Even the Port barrel beers have not been this porty. If you look at recent ratings people are saying this is past it’s best. Who knows but judging it on it’s own merit it’s still quite remarkable it it’s uniqueness and rich flavour. The alcohol is still quite robust. The most surprising thing about this is that De Dolle have never redone this. 2013 postscript - they must have read my mind! 

15th January 2016
That’ll be me 20K then @ ChrisO’s. Almost clear orange beer, small cream colour head. Light palate, decent fine carbonation. Lovely Port Wine flavours with vibrant crystallised fruits. Mild floralness and spice. Touch of fresher red berries. Light semi dry finish. 15+ years on and still fabulous."

Some specific details about this beer that will affect my rating points on this

This beer was held in a colling room at constant temperature for the past 12 years, i’m mearly stating this because i was sceptic about keeping beer chilled all those years and i thought it would kill some of the flavours.

This beer has proved me wrong, as most raters tend to say the beer had gone sour i can’t do anything but saying this beer wasn’t sour at all and has held up superbly !!! 


Head: bottle fizzed ( not gushing just making a sound ) and carbonation was still pretty damn good, white but very thin had that gets out of the way after a couple of minutes 

Colour: totally clear , golden/amberish 

Smell: sweet malts, touch of honey, ever so slight booze that blends perfectly  with the other scents, touch of dairy 

Taste: texture is thick and sweet just like a fine high quality Sauternes !!, superb flavours that are impossible to describe, i don’t know what the beer tsted like fresh, but it’s probabbly pretty close but mellowed to what it actually was, i have never ever had a aged beer that was so balanced, smooth, lively and perfect after 12 ( and even less ) years of aging !.

I never give beers a 5-star rating because i think the perfect beer doesn’t exist, but i’ve been proven wrong , this beer is perfect in my eyes, and if i would be able to trade my cellar for this beer i would do it without a doubt !!!



Loud hooray for De Dolle, the best brewery of Belgium !!"
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 26)",3.8,"750mL Bottle, poured at the B. United table of Beervana - Cranston, RI. Thanks to Matthias for opening this gem. I can’t believe I actually got to try this beer. I had to wait in line for a long time, but it happened. I think the age makes this a bit anticlimatic, as the nose opens with a fair dose of oxidation, despite persistent carbonation and a solid cork. Interestingly, the wet apple note that comes with the oxidation seems to bolster the Calvados-like nature of this beer. The warm, spiced fruit and cooked apple characters of this beer persist and the heat continues to show. Sparklingly dry. A treat for sure, but past its prime."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 27)",4,"Thanks a lot to madmitch for the chance to try this rare beer. Looks good in the glass, not as dark as exspected, small head. Malty-old aroma. Starts very strong, intense malty, hints of caramel and wood. More and more fiery-alcoholic without being too much. Well balanced. Fruity hints of beeries, a bit sourish. Warming aftertaste, goes down burning. Probably already a bit over its top, but still an awesome beer!"
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 28)",5,"opened this to celebrate my new job. 
Look: light brown color with a small head
nose: honey,malts sweet dark fruits, caramel and red fruit
taste: honey, malts, sweet dark fruits, caramel, red fruits, wooden tones, grapes and a nice light bitter finish
feel: full body soft cabonation
overall: last time i had this was 4 yeears ago. How much better this one got! No signs of oxidation at all,pity how a whole group of danish with probably a badly stored bottle imply this one is over the top. Amazingly complex."

Flavor has golden raisins, chocolate, orange peel, and some alcohol, very well balanced.  I’ve been told that the bottle I had the pleasure of being able to sample wasn’t among the best examples of this beer."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 44)",4.2,"Rating #2000 Original rating from about 2 years ago. I was lucky to have this again just recently thanks to chrisq, but sadly that bottle just hadn’t quite held up nearly as well. It was a bit more oxidized and seemed rather muted. 

 Bottle shared with 3/4 and kmweaver. Sweet vinous nose, lots of candied red fruits, toffee and caramel in abundance, light oxidation. Sweetness is upfront on the taste, but it’s not overwhelming, alcohol is there, but kept in check. Caramel and toffee is lightly oxidized producing a sherry note along with a bit of figs and raisins. The red fruits are still very bright and vibrant. Finish is oaky and tannic with a bit of vanilla.  An amazing treat. Thanks for sharing guys!"
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 45)",4.8,"Holy Shit, I never thought Id get to try this, Thanks to OteyJ!
Pour is a murky orange with a surprisingly lively head of offwhite.  Aroma is lively as well, Apricot and nectar fruit dominate in the nose, A bit of brandy, very vinous, great sweet vanilla barrel notes, super creamy and perfectly carbonated.  Falvor is bursting with sweet molasses, sweet barrel notes, white wine, caramel, with a strong finish of maple candy.  Incredible, Jaw dropping, This is a vivacious beer that despite its age is one of the best Ive tasted"
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 46)",4.8,"Probably the best bonus ever. Honestly, are you kidding? Oteyj, jblauvs, and I are about to enjoy this to the absolute fullest. Pours a murky, brownish orange with a small bubbly head, nice lacing that renews incredibly well considering how old this stuff is. Aroma is incredible: tons of nectar fruit like apricot and nectarine, great sweet vinous notes, wood from the barrel aging, raisin and other dark fruits, and some angel food cake and Belgian yeast. Flavor is absolutely freakish. Huge notes of maple candy, nectarine, grape, caramel, brown sugar, plum, raisin, and wine-- so sweet, but so unbelievably good. Palate is obscenely smooth; 12% ABV what? This beer left my mouth agape, my jaw on the floor, and my love of Belgian beers renewed. Could be my favorite beer ever."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 47)",4.8,"MASSIVE thanks to Bo at BA. The pour is opaque apricot with a small white head and low carbonation. The aroma is massively nectar oriented with huge vinous barrel notes, fruity dough, massive dark fruit. The flavor is transcendent. Massive caramel, dark fruit, nectar fruit, dough, grapes, maple syrup, brown sugar, plum, and fig. The alcohol simply isn’t noticeable. The palate is perfect- massively viscous with a sticky coating mouthfeel that doesn’t ever quit. Absolutely divine."

Pours opaque orange with bubbles on the edges and no head. Good lacing. Nose of gingerbread, alcohol, pears, dark dried fruits, brown sugar and biscuit. Taste is figs, bready, candi sugar, undercarbonated but still a nice body. Lingers of spicy yeast, light alcohol, tart fruits, and rum soaked raisins. Very complex.

Probably 2-3 years past its prime and its still a great beer, impressive!"
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 54)",4,"bottle provided by bu11zeye.  as soon as this was opened you could smell the aroma fill the room.  there was a long silence right after opened that i felt the need to break by asking a dumb question.  i think the silence occured 44 minutes into the tasting.  this poured a murky amberish/orange with somewhat of a white head and when swirled could see the legs standing along the glass.  aroma was a fruit basket with pear and orange followed by some honey, fingernail polish, and cinnamon.  flavor was honey, pear, little citrus, and some alcohol was apparent.  body was full with low carbonation and some slickness.  very nice indeed and glad to of had the opportunity to try it."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 55)",4.2,"Rating number 2600. Pours with minimal head and a hazy golden brown body. Aroma of Bordeaux wine fills the room after pouring. Aroma on closer inspection shows alcohol, caramel, florals, wet wood, fusel alcohol with a tinge of berries, wine, and cobwebs. Taste raisins, and rum raisin ice cream, sherry, port, madeira and a whole host of other fortified, vinous wines, rum soaked bred, wine barrels. There is a bit of oxidation, but it is light and pleasant. Some musty notes. Long duration. Warming with light bubbles and an awesome vinous finish. Very pleasant indeed!"
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 56)",4.7,"#1100. Bottle secured by bu11zeye.  Thanks for cuttin me in on this one! Hazy heavy orange that transforms into a lighter shade near the edges. Very intense aroma. Sweet bread, brown sugar, bubble gum, and drier grains crowd the aroma. The sense of alcohol rounds out the complexity and stings the nostrils. Quite a lot of flavors packed in the taste. Sweet and tingly. Taste has sweet grain, brown sugar. Lots of Belgian grain and some aged fruits. Most definitely a sipper and wonderfully enjoyed."

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 59)",4.1,"750 mL bottle at the Relentless Thirst Gathering in Richmond, VA, 8.29.09.  Very happy to see this one. Pours a copper tinted amber color with a thin head. Average head retention and lacing. Aroma is citrus, apple, honey, oak and spicy notes. Taste has peppery spice notes up front. Caramel, peach, apple and other fruit notes along with an almost port-like quality. Medium-full bodied. Medium-full bodied. Very nice."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 60)",4.2,"750-milliliter bottle into wine balloon. Pours a burnt orange, a lot clearer than expected, with just a small film on top. It still is a lot more alive than I expected; very bubbly for a 9-year-old ale. Maybe the supplementary cork helped ensure this. A lot of honey, molasses, brown sugar donut-glaze in the aroma. Maple frosting. Flavor is a nice, fully synergized fusion of caramel, purple grape juice, overripe apricot, sweet red Napa zinfandel. Nice gooey viscosity. Again, unprocessed fresh-from-the-comb honey in the flavor. Yup, this one’s just about ready to drink. Slightly alcoholic flavor/finish/esophageal warmth, but in a most welcome way. Overall, world class minus."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 61)",3.5,"busy and syrupy it is full with raisin, plum and flowery sugar. perhaps a bit too cold it was infused with a wet dank wood flavor... soy like and slow foamy. as one would expect it is like sherry in taste and alcohol aged and mellow."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 62)",4.2,"Huge thanks to pepsican, badbeer, and iowaherkeye. Alcoholic, caramelly nose, raisin. Slightly metallic. finishes nicely-tons of honey-tastes like raw unrefined honey-cigary. Very nice dry character. Probably a little past its prime, but nevertheless very nice."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 63)",3.4,"Murky amber pour with a nice sized white head.  Aroma is very boozy with some plums,  caramel,  and chocolate.  I’ve written raisins a bunch for flavor in my reviews,  but my god!  This is a raisin bomb.  It has a nice sherry style flavor as well.  Finish was boozy.  Not really my thing but fun to try."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 64)",4.2,"Light funk, chocolate, caramel, butter aroma. Yeasty sample - did not look too great. Chocolate, dust, caramel, fruit, a bit cheese. Very complex. Medium body, smooth mouthfeel."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 65)",4.8,"I normally don’t post, but this is to brag.  Had this tonight, and it was amazing.  Has a great, Chardonnay like aroma and flavor, which is probably due to the oak aging, and 8 years.  Very different from the 05 reserva, but in my opinion better.  It doesn’t have the hotness that I remember from the 05 and is very smooth.  It also had a very slight tartness to it that was very refreshing.  The bottle I drank this from is now a very nice trophy for me!  If you can try this, I would highly recommend it."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 66)",4.1,"a great opportunity to try this beer thanks to the rb comunity.  this beer was a bit like watching and old athlete in a come back fight.  still good but past its prime.  great balance and strong fruit presence, a little to mellow in body vs. a newer non reserva.  surprisingly there was some alcohol in the nose along with yeast and  light spice.   i did learn something, don’t hold on to long to the jewels in your collection."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 67)",4,"Orange color, slight head rims the glass. Aroma similiar to sherry mixed with a yeasty bread. Taste like a sherry, vineous, with the flavor dry fruits, apricots, dried apples or mangos. Its a beer I think I could taste something different each time I tried it. Somewhat dry finish. Excellent!"
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 68)",4.2,"Kudos to eyedrinkale for bringing this gem out to share.  Deep golden orange beer.  The aroma is awesome, rich orange peel, apple, pineapple and rich clovey/nutmeg spiciness.  Peach and tangerine with a soft tartness over the sweeter estery character and apple pie spiciness.  Loads and loads of yeasty complexity wrapping around a softly sweet honeyish belgian malt base.  It’s got a nice basementy bit of age that is well integrated with all of the other yeasty characters.  Awesome."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 69)",4.1,"Man, I never in my wildest dreams expected to try this one. Unfortunately, it would seems its past its prime, though still rather nice. The aroma is deep and complex, with anise, pineapple, licorice, and a light bit of alcohol. Though the flavor is rather basic and uncomplex, it is a nice mixture of fruit, deep spices, and a touch of tartness. Very mellow and balanced all around, with a wonderful sweetness."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 70)",3.9,"Most graciously shared by EDA, jez I never thought this would come around.  I was as awed as the rest.  I got one of the early pours from the bottle and then a little from the end to have a nice mix in the glass. Either way the first pour was still pretty murky, could not see through it but it definitely was a glowing golden color. It poured with a small head but it stuck around. Aroma is definitely aged, lots of aged malts that have turned into slightly cardboard but very sweet honey malts. And a cool yet weird moldy/sour old white grape.  Lots of damp basement in the aroma as well. Taste is similar with less of the basement aspect but still plenty sweet.  The ’basement’ maybe the oak. The yeastiness also really breaks through with lots of doughiness. As far as aged beer goes this is held up very well and is very nice to try, again as far as aged beer goes.  So I will rate it as a good ’old beer.’  Thanks again Mike. 750mL bottle, white wine glass."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 71)",4.2,"Bottle generously shared by Eyedrinkale: Rusty auburn pour with a fading off white head. Complex aroma. Vinous, muscat grapes, vanilla, toffee, cork and oak. Slick texture. Slightly sweet flavor with white grapes and toffee. Mild oak hints are there, but they fade into the smooth sweetness of butterscotch into the rich yet smooth finish. No alcohol presence. A great Ale of nice complexity, perhaps past it’s prime at the time I sampled it."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 72)",4.3,"All my rating is gonna say is that this beer is still holding up. Past its prime, perhaps. But still plenty of carbonation. Fruit cocktail, cherries, grapes and the delectible De Dolle yeast I love so much. Share it now folks."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 73)",3.8,"Early pour is lightly hazed and the color of honey - golden copper, soft and pleasant.  A later pour with some of the yeast mixed in it’s obviously more muddy and brown in color.  Sparkling sugar and candied fruit in the nose, a lot of honey scented malt and light candy sugar throughout.  Flavor is big, rich, syrupy and sticky up front.  Alcoholic oranges and bready malts noticed, with even some banana yeast esters present.  Heavy candy sugar throughout the drink, on the sweet side but not overly sweet.   Tannic, dry oak noticed with some sweet almond accents.  The wood character is quite fresh and new throughout, a testament to the care taken in aging the bottle.  Overall it’s exceptionally rich and delicious - sticky and sweet - prickly and exciting.  Incredible."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 74)",4.6,"750mL bottle, courtesy of mwsf, shared trade with acrdz and I.  Goddamn.  Thanks so much, Matt!  Pours a lightly hazy, orange-brown color; honey-yellow edges; good amount of viscosity; solid perimeter of off-white bubbles with patchy lacing.  Loads of honey in the aroma: vinous red fruits, Belgian sugar, cherries coupled with the slightest tartness; some chewy caramel from oxidation, but this doesn’t overwhelm the other, clearer notes; incredibly dense, honey-laden, vinous nose; no show of the alcohol underneath.  Full mouthfeel: similar honey-like sweetness and viscosity that one would expect from the stille nacht, but coupled with lightly tannic red fruits, incredibly complex yeastiness, chewy caramel, and viscous Belgian sugars; this bottle seems to have held up beautifully (thanks to great cellaring, evidently, and large pours); there’s nothing thin about this beer, nothing close to watery or relaxed concentration; I could sip this for effectively forever, and I just might.  Lengthy finish: sweet, complex honey and yeastiness, toasty breadiness, and a touch of red fruits, spicing, and dough.  Just a magnificent, complex, seamless barrel-aged beer that can outlast even our desires to track down and drink every single last bottle of this."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 75)",4.2,"I had this last year and was so utterly impressed that it was aging as well as it had.  This is wonderful, with some woody notes present in the background lingering.  Lots of dark fruit flavors, figs and plums and dates, with just a bit of sweet and sour qualities on the palate.  still lots of sweet honey maltiness blended with caramel and toffee and light candi sugar.  This is excellent!"
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 76)",4.9,"Split bottle with BrianK, (last one) at D.B.A. in NYC who would have thought!   Second time thanks to Mike for sharing this!!  Dark amber pour with minimal lacing/co2, this beer is 8 years old!  Dark fruit plum grape and fig with sweet notes of chocolate caramel sugar and dark wine.  Minimal etoh in taste and scent. WoW what a sick beer.  Im not sure this beer could be better."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 77)",4.8,What a freaking amazing beer.  I found it even more crazy that i purchased it at a bar for $15.  They claimed the single bottle had been sitting in the cellar untouched for years.  What an amazing use of bordeaux casks which imparted a very nice subdued flavor.  Where is the 12%?  It drank like 7 or 8%.  This is probably the best belgian beer i’ve ever had.
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 78)",4.8,"Notes from about a year ago...Thanks Eric!!  Poured a relativly clean amber/orange color with a small but kinda sticky tan head.  The aroma is red grapes, dry merlot, plums, raisins, mild alcohol, and fresh carmel.  Flavors also have some huge merlot characteristics with a little more sweetness.  Tastes of dark fruits, vanilla, honey, light yeast, and a somewaht drier, oaky finish.  Excellent!!"
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 79)",3.6,"Sampled at dark Lord Day, this was from
Mike Sprinkle.Thanks again Mike for the brew and having you as a friend. Lighter in color that I thought it would be.
Still had a nice aroma. Soured fruity notes with plenty of other spices going on. The taste was a bit thin and would hold this up as only a good BSA. I would have loved this 2 years ago."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 80)",4.4,"Thanks Ughsmash for sharing this gem.  The first pour is a glowing reddish amber body.  What I had with fourth pour was a hazy glowing amber body with out the redness.  A foamy white head with spotty lacing sits on top.  The aroma was very vinous Bordeaux with some pineapple, cinnamon, and toffee rounding out the beer.  It was amazingly aromatic, strong, and yet very balanced.  The flavor is sweet quad yeasts with pineapple, toffee, aged malts, light oak, cinnamon, and some very subtle Bordeaux.  Nicely balanced and very nice tasting.  The palate was sweet, slick, warming with no alcohol noticeable to me, and nicely textured.  This beer held up really nicely."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 81)",4.6,"Huge thanks to hopdog for the bottle, Rating #2000!!  Poured clear, fiery medium orange initially (progressively more hazy with subsequent pours).. loose dusting and larger bubbles of off-white head around the edges. 

 The aroma was just exquisite.. definitely a solid dose of Bordeaux influence over a sweet, supple base.. the underlying beer mellowed out considerably, leaving sweet caramel, toffee, and a delicate bouquet of light fruits (peaches, apricots, and some vinous influence).. deeper oak and Bordeaux undertones as well.. almost a sweet bourbon in there too. 

 The flavor begain with an array of sweet lighter fruits, sour oak, and grape skins, followed by warm caramel and toffee on the middle (accented by warm clove and other Christmas-ey spices).. warm back-end with a touch of oak and a bunch more vinous.. very long, warm, sweet and complex finish. 

 Warm and entirely fulfilling on the palate with great balance between sweet fruits, sour barrel influence and grapes, and alcohol warmth.  This was entirely what I needed.  Thank you Steve!!"
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 82)",4.2,"Not my favorite from De Dolle.  But like their other brews, this is totally original.  Sweet?  Crazy intensely sweet.  Definitely good idea to put a couple of year on the Stille Nacht."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 83)",4.1,This generously provided bottled brew from Mike Sprinkle on Dark Lord Day poured a head of frothy fine to medium sized bubbles that were mostly diminishing and left behind a hazy uncarbonated orange brown colored body. The strong aroma was spicy and malt hop. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and strongly tingly at the finish. The complex yummy flavor contained notes of mild spice and malt hop. Delicious and one I would certainly like to drink again but will probably never get trhe chance to sample this sought after brew again.
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 84)",4.3,"Golden coloured beer with a white fluffy head. Aroma is filled with lots of swee candy like notes.

Flavor: This is a truly complex beer.  Everything is so subtle and well-blended.  Amazing flavor that is very difficult to describe.  Light caramel and honey sweetness, bread, sour apples and some vinegar, hint of wood complexity. 

Palate: Medium-full body.  Creamy and milky texture.

Overall: Spectacular beer.  I really wish I could get my hands on a bottle of stuff!  It is so intense and complex and would be prefect to sit and enjoy for hours!"
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 86)",4.6,"Big thanks to Mike for bringing this to DLD--a very generous gesture for certain.  The pour was a nice, slightly hazy golden color.  Small head.  The aroma is lively, with tons going on--green grapes, sour apples, light caramel, honey, light brown sugar and light breadiness.  The flavor matches, with more malt to balance out perfectly the sour tastes and the light fruit flavors.  12% shows up nowhere in the flavor at this point.  Really happy I was able to sample this along with so many others at a great event."

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 88)",4.4,"Bottle shared by Sprinkle at DLD.  Pours a deep golden color with a small white head.  Complex aroma of citrus and a spicy aroma that I couldn’t pin down, yeast maybe, but it was a little more peppery.  Sweet flavor balanced nicely with the wood undertones.  Finish is slightly tart with a lingering sweetness.  An excellent beer and I’m really happy I got a chance to enjoy it."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 89)",4.3,"Shared by sprinkle @ DLD.  Pours a clear orange -yellow with a white head.  Nose of yeast, citrus, orange, apples, a little bread and oak.  The flavors are really balanced out  orange, yeast, oak, citrus, and cookie.  The light sweetness is met with a drying finish and touch of alcohol.  A nice brew and thanks to sprinkle for the pour."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 90)",5,A great bear and only once made becouse of problems with the brew. They used a new yeast for it and half the brew was broken because of it. Instead of pouring it away they choose to put them on to aok barrels. With gave this special brew the finest and most special taste. A top beer

Now onto the beer...I never thought I would get the chance to try this brew but now that I was lucky enough to I have to say it lived up to the hype and everything I thought it would be...even after almost 7or 8 years of age on it.  The aroma was great of belgian yeast, wine, grapes, figs, fruits, and canided sugars.  The palate was great with a little bit of carbonation and a dry finish.  Alcohol was not noticeable at all!  Highly enjoyable!"

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 97)",4.6,"I’ve had this beer saved for 3 years and finally decided to drink it for #1000. Opaque red color with a small off-white head. Aromas of vanilla, fruit, wood, yeast, sweetness and sour. Flavor is very fruity, with some sweetness and sour. More complex than I can describe, but all the flavors are well balanced."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 98)",4.6,"Had this beer a few times...once for only $18 at the Hopleaf in Chicago!!  This is one of the best beers we have ever tasted.  The sweetness is simply incredible combined with the cask flavor.  It’s better than a fine port in its complex fruit flavors and spiciness.  We have probably shared a bottle with Humulone Red about every year since it was made and it has staying power, even with a bit of oxidation (which actually adds some nuttiness that is very nice).  It was great when it was younger and it’s been great each time.  Excellent beer."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 99)",4.7,"Humongous thanks to egajdzis for plucking this dusky jewel...Hello!
2000 - 750 mL
Appears a transparent light gold with a small, soapy head that fades to a hearty collar. Spotty lacing is left around the glass.
Smell is of hearty caramel, brown sugar, raisins, biscuits, vanilla, definite traces of wine, Belgain yeast, along with sugary bread. Small amounts of apples & cinnamon smothered in honey come through with a swirl and an inhale.
Taste is of the mentioned aromas with sugary, honey infused, beauty of a brew bolstering huge complexitites.
Mouthfeel is full bodied, sweet up front, warming, with spices and sugary goodness complimenting each other into an exceptional bliss. Very lip smacking and enticing."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(1, 100)",4.3,"Bottle @ Kulminator, Antwerp, December 2004. Pours a golden amber color with a small off-white head. Aroma is vinous with some hints of dark fruits and some spicy hints. Flavor of dark fruits, raisins. Very vinous with hints of wood. Smooth mouthfeel with a warming vinous finish. Very nice."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 1)",4.7,"Huge thanks to egajdzis for sharing not only this but also the 2005 version side by side! Do you want to take my 1st born - seriously, I can use the sleep! Pourd a medium amber color with a small sized off white head. Quite a vinous and complex aroma. Red wine giving way to grapes, light yeast, vanilla, wood, plums, and raisins. I could smell this one all night. Tastes of red wine, grape skins, brown sugar, vanilla, light wood, dark fruits, and I was getting a light cookie doughiness. Vinous all the way around. Alcohol content well hidden. As good as this was, it continued to grow on me as I drank and smelled it leaving me wanting more."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 2)",4.3,"Courtesy of Tom Peiters at Monk’s Cafe, thanks Tom! Vibrant aroma of candied fruits, white pepper, vintage port blended with moscato, yeast, licorice and vanilla. Also subtle hints of raisins, incredibly sweet malts, dry hickory,  the bottling floor at Domaine De La Romanee Conti. Taste is utterly magnificent. Honey, icing from an oreo ice cream cake, spicy relleno and pear/apricot jellies. Also lingering tastes of bread, anise, molasses, candy sugar. Sourness is as pleasant as I’ve found in an aged Belgian. Finish is absolutely monstrous, ten miles long, holding my palate hostage without a ransom in sight. So complex, so worth the wait, so fun to drink, so fun to watch the look of disgust on my girlfriend’s face when she tries it. Kick ass."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 3)",4.3,"750ml - one of only 1920 bottles produced and aged in Saint Julien Bordeaux casks, thereafter bottled in 2002.  Heady aroma fills the nose with a rich, sugary, honeyish malt sweetness, various tangy, tropical and citrus fruits including pineapple, white grape, orange and juicy green apple, along with some earthy, lightly dusty, woody and herbal tones, dried flowers, a slightly musty and estery yeast presence and a certain peppery alcoholic spiciness, all atop a lightly vinous backdrop that does give betray some notion of the aging vessel and the impetus behind the idea.  Gorgeous deep rosy amber color, slightly hazy, with coppery highlights and a lasting, fine, creamy head accompanied by some fairly intricate lacing.  Flavor profile is equally complex and satisfyingly powerful, with suggestions of candied pears, golden raisin and apricot jam, followed by a light amount of spicy bitterness and warming alcohol, finishing with a degree of drying acidity, a blend of peppery spices and some lingering, fairly strong winey touches here and there.  Silky smooth and lightly sticky on the palate with a hugely full body to support the gratifying palette of flavors found here.  Many thanks to Murph who supplied me with this particular bottle back in the summer of 2003. This has been cellared since that time and of course, had been annually in danger of being consumed, however after tasting it certainly seems able to endure a far longer slumber."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 4)",4.3,"Bottle: Pale gold, nice head and lacing. Nose of plum, cherry, dry port, sweet malts. The flavor is fucking nice and balanced. Subtley sweet and salty/woody with an herbalness and fruity sweet grape taste. Finishes with some honey notes and a tasty cake on the side. Like the richness of Jadwiga. Tons of the good umami in this. I like that the clean bordeaux notes have faded into something completely different over time."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 5)",4.6,"From a 750mL Bottle.  Pours an elegant golden amber with a subtle fire tinge and an even layer of white head.  This beer has everything going on in the aroma - light fruits, dark fruits, spice, vinous character, it just goes on and on.  The first thing to grab my attention are the succulent figs and prunes that decorate the bouquet.  Thoughts of a fine barleywine float through my head before fleeting, being replaced with a distinctly Belgian layer of cinnimony yeasty spice.  Soft, ripened pears and sugary muscat grapes also float gently to my nose, blending artistically with the dark fruity spice.  Rich, full body - lightly syrupy, but at the same time well carbonated mouthfeel.  This is a big beer that hasn’t lost any balance or succumbed to the effects of age.  More fruits flood my tongue.  I continue to be amazed how hoards of figs, prunes, raisins, peaches, apricots, caramel, and spice can coexist together so beautifully.  Each taste is savored carefully, revealing more new fruit sensations before culminating in a subtly woody, majestic finish.  This beer is one of those gems that is truly worth all the praise it receives.  Big thanks to Chris for giving me the chance to try this fabulous beer."

Oranges, raisins, bit of red plums, berry-ish and fruity - like a dessert. Dried peach and fresh pineapple, also a bit salty. Vineous. This beer is very well balanced, with an ABV that is not notable. Smooth body. Fitting X-mas beer. Smells and tastes big. A fantastic beer."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 10)",3.9,"Another rare beer that Degarth so graciously shared with me, yet 9 months later I am ratting it!  Sorry for my procrastination! I actually thought I had already reviewed this De Dolle after our tasting, apparently not!  

 Poured a hazy rusty orange hued body and a kakhi brown head. The aroma radiated a cornucopia of fruit; apples, sweet red & tart green, plums and pears. Amass of beet sugars on the front of the flavor profile, followed by oak, vinilla and a suggestion of apple cider. There was a bit of sourness, mostly from the cask aging, the oxidation was minimal for a 6 year old beer. Overall, as exceptional as this beer truly was, it was too sweet, which helped hide the bold Alc, yet it was still phenolic and aggressive; and although Truly toned down from the original yearly release of Stille Nacht, this baby was still a monster… even with 6 years of life behind it."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 11)",5,"Happily shared at Choice City in Fort Collins. Beer poured a medium, hazy caramel brown without a head to really speak of. The first impression on the nose: sweet, warm, caramel apple lovies on toast, yet so much more. One of a handfull of beers I’ve ever had that create a transcendant experience of beauty. The kind where the sum of the parts combine to create a divine whole that overwhelms and makes the world fall away with the sound of a down comforter being dropped to the ground. The aroma was malty with moderate toasted grain, heavy, warm, sticky, drippy caramel, moderate-to-heavy cookie notes; Hoppy with mellow moderate herb note, trace note of resin and pine and a light note of lemon zest; Yeasty with moderate funky notes of attic and cellar, light cookie doughiness; Moderate-to-heavy green apple peel and simmered apple, vanilla-heavy oak,moderate warm, spicy alcohol, lightly vinous on the back of a deep inhale. The flavor was heavily sweet (not sticky or cloying in the least), lightly to moderately acidic, warm and  lightly bitter. The finish was warm, moderately sweet, lightly bitter. ABV cloaked in the sweet, warm folds. The body was full, the texture was velvety/syrupy and the carbonation was soft.  Thanks for sharing this BeerandBlues2, Mrs. BeerandBlues2 and Ernest. This experience was all the better for having good friends beaming back the same shit-eating grin over this treasure."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 12)",5,"Again, this was shared moments after our De Dolle Special Brouwsel with Ernest, luckygirl and my wife at Choice City Butcher and Deli in Ft. Collins, Colorado.  Pours a effervescent light copper with a patchy white film.  Aroma is huge; buttery caramel malt, sweet brown sugar, alcohol, oak and apple.  Butterscotch flavor, caramel malt and apples, moderately acidity creates some spice, creamy maltiness in the middle and near the end, alcohol notes and dryness at the end.  Full bodied and warm, creamy palate but dry and spicy-fizzy finish."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 13)",4.2,"Anything above 4 is a great beer, this one is excellent but I prefer their oerbier.  Great for a winter night, unfortunately I drank this in mid-summer Atlanta - maybe I would have rated it better in Wisconsin."

Fore is a huge and tasty mouthful of fruit with apple standing out. Strong hints of wood and wine some mild candy sugar notes with a stiff kick of alcohol in the finish. Nice flavor progression and the apple fruitiness is nice with the woody notes. Great beer, but almost feel like it could have benefited from yet another year of aging."

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 18)",5,"Produced in 2000, Stille Natch Reserva is a very special, limited addition of De Dolle’s seasonal Christmas brew, Stille Nacht or ""Silent Night."" Stille Natch is a very special beer to begin with, but De Dolle really out did themselves when they decided to do Reserva. Stille Nacht is brewed with with pale malts, white candy sugar, is hopped, and then dry hopped with Nugget hop varieties, and comes in at a warming 9-10% abv. De Dolle boils this beer for 5 hours, making it a very high gravity brew. It is then bottle conditioned, and will continue to develop in the bottle. 

Any vintage of Stille Nacht is a true gift to any beer lover, but a 750ml corked bottle of the Reserva is truly a Christmas treasure. Reserva takes it to a whole new realm. Reserva was produced in 2000, and was aged for 18 months in Bordeaux wine barrels before being bottled. This age in the wine barrels, gives an already incredible beer a level of complexity, flavor, and character, that is in a class by itself. Reserva comes in at a warming 12% abv, making a very potent beer as well. 


Stille Nacht Reserva pours to a beautiful, hazy, deep golden color with a thick and creamy pillow of a head, and a lively and vibrant carbonation. The nose on this beer is incredibly complex and aromatic with big robust aromas just bursting in the air. Aromas of sweet malt, oak, candy sugar, deep vinous notes, spicy hops, and peppery alcohol flood the nose. The plate on this beer is rich and full, yet at the same time, has a nice bit of acidity, that dances on the tongue. Big, robust flavors of sweet malt, light caramel, oak, pepper, black berry, and vinous flavors, coat the tongue and glide down the palate. It is almost too much of a good thing, as your taste buds will be on bliss over load. Reserva finishes with more complex flavors up front, then ends with very vinous, acidic, and peppery flavors that linger on the tongue for quite sometime. 

In a word, this beer is stunning. This beer was one of the most enjoyable beers I have drank, ever. The age in the Bordeaux barrels really give this beer a whole new dimension. The vinous qualities of this beer combined with the fantasic malty overtones and warming alcohol makes this one of the most delicous beers ever produced in my opinion."

Smells of black currants, oak, figs leafs, and aged cherries, reminiscent of a finely aged bourbon.  Tastes of caramel, cherries, sangria and too many other sensations to describe.  Leathery finish.  My only regret is that I do not have another bottle of this one in my cellar."

Pours a dark brown with a fine lasting head. The glass is exploding with light chocolate and dried figs, dates and raisins. Loads of oriental spices and vanilla. In fact this beer is a liquid version of an English Christmas Cake. The mouthfeel is one of an extremely fullbodied beer with a lot of sweetness that is yet perfectly balanced by the afterburn of alcohol. This is an exceptional beer!!!! No doubt one of the 1-2 best beers I’ve ever had, which is why I managed to taste it 4 times during the festival with consistent tasting notes. So yes, my rating will be a clean-cut no-nonsense 5.0, but that is only because the scale stops there.........."

with lots of oak, vanilla, caramel and much more than I can describe. Taste again reminds me of a great port, with an incredibly silky smooth texture. Sweet, but never cloying.

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 40)",5,"05.22.05  750 shared at jimmack04 invitational.  The third time I’ve had this brew and each time is better than the first.  This beer, each time I enjoy it, produces another one of those magical beer moments where it’s almost impossible to pick up the pen to write any notes.  The first two times I’ve had it, I didn’t even bother, this time I knocked off at least something to make it official...This beer is a 30 year old wood aged port in disguise.  In fact, nothing from Bordeaux has ever come close to what De Dolle managed to extract from this wood.  Honey colored and wonderfully viscous with an unfortunately sudsy, sort of soapy head, but at least it still shows some carbonation despite its age and size.  Color and clarity are gorgeous.  The body is pure silk.  Forget every other time I said a brew had a velvet or silken palate.  I was an idiot.  This brew glides on Apollo’s wings across the palate, pure love.  The flavor embodies all that is ancient wooded port, hints of sherry, dry spices.  It’s a Christmas vigil with the fireworks of the 4th of July.  It’s sweet, savory, and deep, while its still making a sweet case for attention.  Hell, it’s too good to deal with the pen in my hands; it takes two hands to control this snifter."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 41)",4.6,Bottle. Thanks Willblake. Nice amber in color with a fluffy white head. Aroma of port wine with fruity notes. Port wine flavor with fruity notes. Nice malty character. Candi sugar notes. Smooth tasting.  Enjoyable. Drinkable. Wow.
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 42)",4.8,"Bottle thanks (and a very big thanks) to Willblake at the Jimmack invitational tasting. Clear golden, white head. Fine port wine aroma and flavors, with very fruity candy like notes. Lingering malts. Smooth and mellow. This is one fantastic brew that I never thought I would get to try. Thank you again Jon!"
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 43)",4.9,"Bottle at the 4/17/2005 Montreal tasting, shared with Rastacouere, Muzzlehatch, Tiggmtl, MartinT, Beerbuzzmontreal, Olivier and Simon.  Sipped while cooincidentally listening to the Beatles’ ""I want you"".  Aroma bursts forth from the bottle a full, intense and divine creation of sensory stimulants.  So good, the bottle was passed around and people waited in line to get ""seconds"" of smelling the bottle.  I described the aroma as ""just pure goodness"" but I will try to elaborate on that.  Fully rounded, never sharp notes of soft oak woodiness, red berries, soft grapes, caramel, toffee, sweet cherries, marzipan, maple, vanilla, subtle yet strong Belgian yeast, touches of light dough/honey and a bit of drying tannins for balance.  Wow.  Appearance is a thick-looking vibrant auburn-copper-amber color, with lacing as the small white head quickly recedes (no doubt 5 years in the cellar, oak aging, and a high alcohol).  Can the flavor live up to the aroma? It’s possible, I dare to think.  And to some extent, it does.  The flavor of a beer, in my mind, is a much more difficult beast to control and perfect, having to meld balance, mouthfeel and actual taste altogether perfectly.  Perhaps I am just an easier judge of aroma, but it seems easier to imagine a perfect aroma than a perfect flavor.  That being said, there was a little less intensity to the flavor than the aroma, some very light oxidation, a touch of dryness where it dosent belong and maybe a slight receding of firm, thick maltiness.  But this is criticism the beer brings upon itself.  I think near-perfect beers are easier to find faults with, being so close to perfect.  It is easy to hold them to a higher level, created by their sheer magnificence.  The malt is nonetheless, thick, rich, creamy and filling.  Candied apples, soft notes of smoked cinnamon, vanilla, syrupy cherry liqueur of the finest variety.  Bits of dry barley, light maple, playful Bordeaux wine fruitiness and light oak, never overdone, on the finish.  Distinct Belgian nuances from the yeast, light raisins, dates, plums and delicate brown sugar.  Perfect mouthfeel, full and not thin ever, but yet so easily drinkable for me.  Alcohol gives some warmth as it goes down, but does not show anywhere near 12%.  A most treasured experience, drinking this beer, and hopefully, with some luck, one I will have again.  Score is very difficult to give on this as far as flavor and overall,  I could easily justify a perfect score, especially taking in to account the graceful way this has aged.  But I will discount the flavor a point, and see what I think next time I have it."

The coppery, translucent, still whiskeyish oily body bodes well...the head is tiny and off-white but lasts....a whiff out of the bottle is sufficient to discover maple liqueur inhabiting an alien world with raisins, dates, anise and tar...in the glass is smokiness and delicate herbs, a touch of oaky vanilla...the greatest of barley wines with Belgian yeast....moderately sweet in the body, the alcohol warms and soothes yet never tires or sharpens...raisiny, oaky, smooth and toasty, liqueur-filled candy resting in mellow whiskey.  While we went into raptures over this transcendent experience Abbey Road was playing, ""I want you, I want you so baaaad, I want you so baaaad, it’s driving me maaad, driving me mad."""

Mind blowing and complex flavor of maple, caramel, candy, fruits, honey and alcohol with a sweet finish. Light body, enjoyable liquorous and sticky texture, soft carbonation. Whoa, that’s an incredible beer, as Rasta wrote it’s incredibly decadent ! This is the crown jewel of an amazing tasting session."

Opaque golden caramel coloured body with partial cover and ring of off-white head.  Woody, tannin-full flavour is thick, brown, round and doughy with huge sweetness and very pleasant, boozey, alcohol burn in the throat.  Brown sugar and huge maple sweetness liger.  Medium-full body with fair carbonation and strong alcohol warming.  Liqueur-like texture.

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 47)",4.8,"Bottle-conditioned, obtained thanks to my newest great buddy sprinkle (the holy grail! Finally!): cloudy dark orangey amber. Minimal lacing on disappearing head. Woah that nose! This has to be one of the best smells ever. Extremely vinous and potent. The Bordeaux wood really comes through, basking its glory into an already capable beer. I’ll sound like I’m just enumerating, but this is an equilibrium, trust me, everything at the right place and everything does include a lot of things! Sharp cookie dough flavours, cinnamon powder, vanilla, maple, barley sugar, bananas, oranges, pancakes, nutmeg, pears, nuts.. lots and lots of flavours. Complexity layer over complexity layer. It somehow manages to remain diplomatic, begs to be sipped while forcing you to take your time through pure transcendence and force. WOAH! Yeast overload in mouth, this is more than doughy, it’s a pure French toast. Vinous dates, sweet desserty liquor, a big liquid cake. I’ve no idea how so many flavours can be balanced, no idea. It’s almost a case of name as many flavours as you can and have fun finding them in here. Magnetic sheer polar extremes. Velvet mouthfeel, silky full body, soft carbonation, venerable in that aspect. Evolving flavors, complex, elegant, what more do you want? Decadent stuff. If a beer has ever lived up to the hype, this is it, I’d dare even find it underrated as a matter of fact ;-) That this was possibly not the best bottle of this tasting I consider as the best I’ve been part of is an indication of how good my dreams will be in the next few days."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 48)",4,Big and wonderful brew of great depth. Figs and plums dance with madeira nd port notes with a tannic quality. Chocolate coated caramel and nuts with sherry like qualities. This beer changes flavors throughout its temp change.
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 49)",5,"Shared this one with Carlo (lachesis) at Kulminator in Antwerp - thanks a lot my friend!!!!
Pours hazy copper colored with a foamy tan head. The aroma is just amazing, very full and complex and one you can sniff for hours. Fruity, caramelly with tones of prunes, raisins, cookie, yoghourt and a tone of alcohol. Woody hints as well. The flavor leaves nothing behind from the aroma. Sweet fruit, yoghourt again, raisins, brown sugar. Soft still dry in the mouth, thick and creamy almost like syrup. Just amazing! An awesome beer enjoyed at an awesome bar with awesome company!!!!Rerate, tasted 25th of June 2005 at Kulminator.
I feel very fortunate to be able to taste this beer again within less than two month thanks to an amazing bar owner who was clever enough to stock a bunch of these fine beers. Unfortunately it looks like he too will be running out soon but rumours say that a new batch has just been poured into barrels and will be released in 2007...!!! Anyway, I’m no longer in doubt, this beer is perfect in all aspects and I CAN NOT thing of anything in the whole wide world beeing greater! My first (and only) 5.0. Thank you Kris and De Dolle for putting heaven into a bottle!"
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 50)",4.5,"Another outstanding beer from our insane tasting with JCW, Silphium, and BelgianGirl.  Rich malty aroma, dark dried fruits, peppery alcohol, caramel and butterscotch, grapeskins, mellow chocolate.  Sweet caramel flavor with all the complexities of the aroma is balanced by the alcohol.  Medium body but very satisfying.  Wonderful beer.  Now, how can I get my hands on another bottle?"
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 51)",4.7,"I couldn’t come up with a better nightcap than this beer!  Provided by JCW, shared with Brodie and BelgianGirl.  Slightly hazy orange-red body, medium/thick light cream head.  Sweet brown sugar aroma with caramel, oak, and alcohol.  Very sweet body (much like the regular Stille Nacht in that regard), with plenty of caramel and residual sugars playing off a variety of sweet fruits, including plum, figs, a touch of cherry, pear, apple, and persistent vinous white grapes.  The alcohol provided a touch of heat, but this component was cut by the sweet sugary malts.  Everything I expected and more.  This beer cements De Dolle as my favorite Belgian brewer.  Incredible."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 52)",4.6,"Consumed at Heeren van Liedekercke (near Brussels). This is one of the most complex beers I have tasted. It was difficult to identify the specific flavors, since the beer had mellowed over several years in the bottle. Very warming and enjoyable on a cold winter night."

Hazy amber color. Porto like, a bit woody, raisins... (aroma and flavors). Excellent!"
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 54)",4.2,"Excellent. A delicious beer that I had at Christmastime but have neglected to rate since, so my memory is a bit foggy, but I do remember its amazing qualities. It wasn’t a super dark beer, but was somewhat cloudy. The flavour was amazingly complex, among the most complex I’ve ever had, quite frankly. A dazzling tapestry that did a flawless dance amongst my tastebuds, reminding me of citrus, cloves, cinnamon, vanilla, and just tasted like Christmas in a glass."

The aroma is nuts, apple, hazelnut, syrupy sweet malt, wood, port, honey, vanilla.  Taste is lemon, pepper, sweet syrupy malt, grapefruit, honey, wood, caramel, vanilla, ripe fruit.  Finishes dry with sweet honey, fruits, wood, and nuts.  Medium bodied.  Balanced in every way, and very complex."

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 58)",5,"Bottled. Purchased at Kulminator. Pours a blushing amber with a very small, refined tan head. Aroma is KNOCK OUT! Huge alcohol notes, rum-soaked fruits, vanilla, maraschino cherries, light woody notes, wine and raw sugar. Taste is phenomenal! Syrupy sugar notes, more alcohol, wood, vanilla, dark ripened fruits, hints of maple syrup and rum cake. Body is thick and chewy but has a velvety and syrupy feel. Definite alcohol warming to this as well. It just slides down your throat, warming the whole way. Finish is just as divine as the rest. More fruit notes, vanilla, alcohol, wood, brown sugar and some hints of cake. Awesome beer!"
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 59)",4.3,"Sampled at the Kulminator in Antwerpen, Belgium. I thought this beer seemed a little expensive, at 20 euros for the 750 mL bottle, but regardless I had to try it. 

Golden. 

Very pleasant nose. Complex. Dryness and fruitiness of the bordeaux barrels along with notes of pears, apples and various cane sugars.

Everything I was hoping it would be. Fruity throughout. Front is melon and pears. Mid-palate is full of notes of lemon. The finish is lovely, finishing with various sugars, cinnamon and oak."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 60)",4.7,"Wow ! What an outstanding brew ! Fantastic beer with a hazy Red-orange shine. Complex aroma’s of nuts and red forrest berry’s. Almost the smell of a old Burgundy wine. Fine hints of dried apricots, cedar wood, and orange marmalade but also the smell of cakes and freshly roasted pinepits, Calvados Hors d’age and touche of freshly made croisants with real butter that is melting on it. The taste is also very wine like ( Hongarian Tokay wine ). This masterpiece has a Full and round mouthfeel with a lot of freshness. In the taste you can notice hints of Ripe red fruits, some nuts, vanilla, top quality Normandian applecider and fine BUAL Madeira. The balans of all the components is perfect (Freshness, alc sweetness and body). Last tasted with the Bierkônig from Denmark and his Maria, at the Kulminator in Antwerp."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 61)",4,"Doughy yeast, raison, maple syrup, molasses, chestnuts, and candi sugar in the nose.  Sweet mouthfeel that is saved from being too sweet by nuts and black strap molasses.  Slight oakyness and notes of fermenting dark fruits and brown sugar."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 62)",3.2,"And I thought Speedway stout at $10 US was pricey. This one was $16 US. Sour flanders style aroma. Amber. Light head and lacing. I found this to be sour, salty and somewhat syrupy. Not a big fan."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 63)",4,"Aroma of hops, sugar fruit aromas. Pours a gorgeous cloudy orange-yellow, nice thick white head. Flavour is all smooth sweetness. Goes down easy for 12% alcohol. Why drink wine when you can drink this. An interesting beer and very satisfying."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 64)",4.6,"This beer just keeps getting better everytime I try it. The first time I had a large sample of it was June ’03 at the Hopleaf in Chicago. Before and since I have only had a small sample.   I will take what ever I can get of this nectar.
Gorgeous orange. Small head. Very complex nose. Oak, fruit, nutty. It has all those tastes in the body plus a nice funkiness. A slight lactic bite. Then a nice alcohol warming.
A friend described it to me like this. It is like a flower blooming. As time passes it opens up into something new. I agree."

The color is a slightly hazy amber with a small disappearing beige head. The flavor is very much like the aroma but combined with the alcohol prickling the tongue. This is truly a fantastic beer."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 67)",4.5,"This is a gorgeous beer! Hazy auburn color that just reeks of clovey tanginess. So much different than the regular Still Nacht - the flavor here is just  so big and complex, like a musky flemish red that isn't sour but coats the mouth perfectly. Fruity cloves, tangy but very smooth, such a complex beer. If I didn't know better, I'd almost call this a Trappist Belgian Red."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 68)",4.5,"Aroma is of sour apples. Incredible slightly cloudy peach color, good head. Mouthfeel is balanced and damn near perfection. The palate is a bundle of apples, both sweet and sour, and some slight earthy flavors. Some vinous elements. Finish is clean and slightly cloying. Almost a flemish style ale. This is an incredible beer, now I know why people want it so bad!"
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 69)",4.7,"Golden hue with nice creamy head and great lace. Aroma was beautiful almost a sherry like vinous character. Sweet wood nose leads to a fruity and yeasty esters. The aromatic hops shine as well. The taste is equal to the challenge. Sticky sweet with a tart acidic undertone. The fruity and bitter tones add to the complexity of this fine beer. Soft yet lively mouthfeel with a minor alcohol feel. Wow, great stuff. Get a taste if you can. Thanks Aaron for letting us share the love."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 70)",4.6,"Oh.  My.  Golly.  Bright golden.  Luscious nose, woody, lots of vanilla, some quiet fruitiness.  First impression on this hitting the mouth is a beautifully thick palate, rich and smooth, very much like what I expect when I hear the word ""nectar"".  Just hugely vinous and full.  Nice fruitiness, lots of soft melons and peaches.  Spiciness and sugary character as well.  Really some lovely stuff.  To phrase my love of this beer, as we finished it at argo0's winter beer tasting I asked if I could take the bottle upstairs to the bedroom to spend a little ""quality time"" with it.  I did, actually, and it was a beautiful experience.  Or so I thought, but then the bottle never called me again.  Bastard.  Hope you get recycled into a Bud Light bottle, you insensitive ass."

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 72)",4.8,"Poured a golden color with an orange hue and a white head with beautiful lacing.  Vanilla, vinous (certainly from the bordeaux casks).  Oak, and bordeaux are present in the taste accompanied by a tongue biting warming alcohol.

[Update 8/05] Drank this again for my third time last night, and i’m noticed some butterscotch in both the aroma and flavor. 

[Update 1/07] That was one bad bottle with diactyl...we had another one last night and it was pretty darn nice."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 73)",4.8,Nice white-tan head.  Strong aroma consisting sweet malt and alcohol.  Flavor is an assault on taste buds.

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 74)",4.9,"Poured out of 750 mL bottle, shared with friends at Stuffed Sandwich in San Gabriel, CA, 10/15/03.  Unbelievable.  Probably the best beer I've ever had, and sure to remain one of the truly great beers that I'll ever have.  Pours to a mostly transparent golden brown apple cider colour with a medium head that mostly fades and leaves little lacing.  Nose is of heaven.  Meaning of oak, oak, malt, oak, some fruit, candy, and a little oak.  Taste is of sweet stinging malt, incredible bright oak, light and fruity, like a sweet delicious juicy cork.  Absolutely fantastic.  Notes of walnut and pecan from the oak and sweet candy sugar after years of aging.  Smooth and wonderfully balanced, velvety and long-finishing.  I liked the regular Stille Nacht a whole lot, but this stuff is absolutely out-of-this-world.  If I could ever get my hands on another bottle, I'd love it like it was a sweet virgin."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 75)",4.7,"This is one of the few beers that I've seeked out that delivered more than I was expecting. The odd thing is that my reason for not expecitng more from this beer was that I had had the regular Stille Nacht and wasn't impressed. This, on the other hand, is AMAZING. The color is a nice apple cider and amber with good clarity. Likely the age fo the beer had allowed the yeast to really stick to the bottom because it never got cloudy even toward the end.  Nice glow. Aroma: Some spice, cotton candy, cider vinegar, alcohol. I know I mention the vinegar, but it doesn't show up in the flavor and is only a small part at the very end of the aroma. It actually adds to the quality of the aroma instead of detracting. The flavor is nicely malty, toffee and caramel. Very fruity like cherries and apples. Underneath you can actually taste the wood of the cask. Slightly winey. I'd put it easily in my top five. The guy I split the bottle with agreed. If I could find cases of this, I'd buy them. Wow."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 76)",3.8,"Pours with an amber gold body topped by a medium thick white fizzy head that disappears quickly and leaves some lace on the glass.  Slightly sweet yet mostly sour vinous aroma.  Sweet fruity vinious flavor with malty accents and sour notes. Medium to full bodied, slightly oily yet dry, with a tingle from carbonation and a slight warming sensation."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 77)",4.1,"Thick, almost syrupy, lots of ethanol.  A very strong wine profile is present here.  Nose is sweet with cotton candy aromas.  The beer finishes sweet like a dessert wine.  Alcohol noticeable in the finish, as are estery notes of apples and pears.  Im glad this beer had a few years to cellar or it would definitely be too sweet I think."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 78)",4.1,"Cheers to CaptainCougar for sharing a bottle of this.  Dark brown color.  Alcohol apparent in aroma.  Buttery, rummy mouthfeel.  Sweet and vinous.  As the Cougar said, tastes like a barleywine."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 79)",4.1,"Thanks to Portlandrunk for delivering this hard to find gem: Pours a murky bronze color with a thin lacey white head.  Thick, alcoholic caramel malt, Bordeaux oak aroma.  Lots of sweet malty flavor, alcoholic oak and dark fruits.  Great complexity, but not much beer flavor more like a liquor.  Reminds me somewhat of Fish Tale Leviathan barleywine.  I would not have guessed this to be a Belgian beer.  Nothing like the regular Stille Nacht."

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 82)",3.8,"Another beer that was opened at the Summer Gathering and sat lonely for a long time, maybe with all the other greats this one was lost in the shuffle.  To me it seemed more like a cognac, or barrel aged ale, but with  some grape, cherry and other sweet fruit flavors.  Very alive and complex, hard to grasp all of the flavors.  Certainly lots of smokey wood and cherries, some soft sugar and spice. Biting alcohol at the end."

Quite tart/sour in the nose, heavily vinuous, dry chardonnay like.  hints of esters, banannas mostly, alcohol and a sweet malt character.  Sweet and tasty, nice full mouthfeel.  SMOOTH velvety soft then, as it leaves the mouth alcohol and dryness overcome all.  Well drawn out finish of sweet caramely malts and dry notes of barley.  Tart and highly alcoholic, but great big sweet malt back-up allows for that kind of assertiveness.  Fruity oiliness comes through as well.  Just awesome stuff, I could drink one of these a day for sure.  Great balance, great complexity, unique and well, GREAT."

The nose holds heavy notes of tawny port, maple syrup, French oak and light sourgham molasses. Lesser notes of anise, yeasty bread dough, banana, alcohol and plums.
The flavor is of tawny port, molasses, candy sugar, apricot and other things excellent. Clover honey along with an astringent, lightly bitter and acetic hop presence on the backside. Also, plenty of warm alcohol.

The air is cold, clean and perfectly fresh . . . I recline on a grassy hill to take a big breath of the still fresh air - sweet wine, fresh baked banana bread, and candied hay, mix with the moist air from a icy, slow moving creek from below. . . from over the hill apple blossoms waft into the air as well.  I open my picinc basket for a midnight snack, I find fresh green apples to go with some bitter cheese, bits of bread complete a wonderful treat.  In addition I dig out some great fruits: strawberries, cantalope, and honey dew.  Ah, if this night could last forever. . ."

Excellent!"
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 90)",4.5,"Foxy-orange. Very slight, white head. Vineous nose, complex, like very old sherry, acetic acid, fruit. Taste is vineous again, esterish. Dried apricots and nuts. Some Brettanomyces too, 't would seem. After some time, a lactic component. Slick, oily mouthfeel. Dry. Alcohol- and acidburn. A bit nutty aftertaste, that and the esters keep flavour going for a long time. Complex is too shallow a word. Very old fortified wine procures similar flavours, similar impressions. Truly superb realisation."

Vinous cherry tinge, juicy crystal malt, candied grape skin, medicine, and leather, atop a trace of earth and musty wood.  Light acidic feel up front.  Soft, lightly velverty carbonation; full bodied.  Beautiful, sweet plummy malt profile, followed by leather and grape skin.  Mildly bitter prune notes.  Lingering spicy medicinal cherry flavors alongside soft notes of wood, plum, leather, and intertwined rich nutty/bready malts.  Semi-coarse alcoholic textures and a mild, tingly sourness brush the back of throat.  Perfect level of acidity to counter the trademark Stille Nacht sweetness.  This showcases some of the most delicous malt flavors I've experienced.  The 12% abv is masterfully hidden."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 94)",4.4,"Pours golden amber and orange with just a hint of red.  Very little head that eventually became a nice, white ring around the top that just stuck around.  The aroma was very interesting and totally unexpected.  The alcohol is evident, but also allows other things to come out-- grape/raisin, apricot, plum, banana and ripe apples ready to turn.  I knew that I didn't know what to expect with the flavor, so I guess I was only sort of surprised by what I encountered.  Sort of sweet with some alcohol, the flavor was very interesting.  Woody notes, vanilla, all that fruit and then just a hint of floral character in the end.  A tremendous brew that was an awesome find."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 95)",3.6,"Ahhhh, the spin of the Belgian fest if there was one...i spin and what do i get...the wild space. Of 87 belgian beers to choose from..what shall i choose? I turn to my compatriots for assistance..Dasilky, jcalabre, 21iceman40...and DeDolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000 is the resounding answer...thus it was and thus the bottle was cracked for all ratebeerians alike!!! The aroma was the goddamn funkiest amalgamation i had smelled in a while. The first whiff i took which was more of a passing sniffer got pancake syrup. Seriously...blueberry pancake syrup!!! A more proliferated whiff picked up apples, oranges, blueberry, doughiness, and still syrup with a minor alcoholic presence. The taste does make some attempt to hide that 12% ABV which is JUST MASSIVE but in the end nothing can be done to hide the monster beneath. Some definite brandy-like qualities here. I like the orangey citrus aspects, a nice oak quality as well..it almost possesses the aged idea and by osmosis it gets transferred over to your taste buds. Very tummy warming and dry as hell given that whopping 12% alcohol content. Very medium to low carbonation, some fruityness..heavy alcohol, but a beer that must be tried...and im still glad i rolled the wild on that wheel!!!"
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 96)",4.2,"I have to agree with Oakes on this one but at the same time rate it significantly higher. One dimensional, sherry like with the woodiness apparent in both flavor and aroma. Alcohol strength and warmth does provide some balance against the prevalent sweetness. Seemed to balance out better the longer it sat in the glass."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 97)",4,This is where my notes start getting hazy. Like trying to decipher hieroglyphics. But I still remember this one. Oaky and sweet with hints of butterscotch. Alcohol was evident but well maintained. An excellent full bodied brew that was one of the highlights for me. Also means I dont have to open my bottle!
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 98)",4.5,"I must say that there are some very cool designs on the label.  A very nice malty, muddy amber color with an able amount of head.  Nice alcohol hint to the smell and the flavor.  Taste resembles brandy, blackberry brandy at that.  This is a big beer, most impressive."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 99)",4.3,"Light brown color. Medium head. Aroma is malty, honey and orange. Malty and somewhat thick. Texture is thick and somewhat oily. It very reminiscent of Grand Marnier. Very smooth. Very sweet and orangish. Great sipping beer. The 12% alcohol is evident with it oiliness and it tummy warming, but it not harsh at all.  VERY nice. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000,"(2, 100)",3.9,"I dont remember much of last night..but i do remember being warmed by this big, bold, enormous, gigantic, colossal beer...It poured golden, almost clear, and sporting a thin halo of suds along the edge of the glass..an aroma of apples, sourness, alcohol, orange peel, and cider vinegar lifted from the glass as flavors of apple spice, yeast, cinnamon, and sugary sweetness played around the enormous alcohol heat..."

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Barrel-Aged Vietnamese Coffee,"(1, 49)",4.5,"Tap at AleSmith Brewery Tap Room

Aroma: well rounded roasted aroma, caramel, coffee. But this beer really have a great balanced flavor. The coffee, malt and bourbon scents are all there and very distinct. High definition, and great smell. Usually, a stout will have multiple levels of smells and they would be blended together, but this stout have all scents and they are very easy to pick out. And it's the authentic coffee, authentic roasty smell. 4.6/5

Appearance: At a certain stage when everything is correct, I look for the corners. This beer hits all the marks, and what I have to say is the lace. Truly beautiful. Great lace retention. 4.6/5

Flavor: again, very similar to the aroma, this beer is great on all flavors, and the barrel aging just make all the flavors more balanced and all rounded. I can clearly take the bourbon, caramel, vanilla, coffee, malt. I would say this is indeed THE BEST STOUT I have tried so far. 4.75/5

Mouthfeel: smooth, thick, full body, but with all the good sides on bourbon. 4.5/5

Overall: The reason why I love this beer is because it just brings all the designed flavors in a very great way. Since they have another blue mountain coffee stout version, and this Vietnamese coffee is just a bit better. I don't wanna give it a 10/10 since you never know if there are more good stuff outta there. 18/20."

The aroma is nice showing notes of dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee, earthy roasted malt, some toasted hazelnuts and oak laden vanilla along with a soft touch of bourbon over a dark toasted caramel malt base. The flavor follows suit with the notes of rich dark chocolate and darkly roasted coffee and earthy bitterness up front and backed up nicely by the burnt caramel and the dark roasted malt base. As it warms the bourbon and oak laden vanilla really shine along with a nice nutty character. Really nice balance between the rich and roasty coffee and the bourbon barrel. Full bodied and smooth with soft carbonation that leads to a lengthy dark chocolate, roasted coffee, vanilla, and bourbon oak finish that just lingers long after each sip.

Nie spodziewałem się, że ten dzień tak szybko nadejdzie i w dość szybkim tempie dojdę do tego poziomu.
Ba! Nie zamierzam się nawet wycofać i dalej podążam w poszukiwaniu tzw. beer whalez. 
Zostało już ich na prawdę niewiele (oczywiście mowa o tych nieodhaczonych w Top50 RB;). Niektóre będą niezwykle ciężkie do zdobycia, ale wierzę, że uda mi się kiedyś wypełnić ranking powiedzmy do poziomu 45/50.
Cheers!🍻

Alkohol: 12% obj.

Wersja: 2016

Kolor: Czarny jak oczy diabła. Kompletny brak przejrzystości.

Piana: Trudna do zidentyfikowania, ponieważ po odkapslowaniu pojawił się mocny gushing. Beżowy kolor i struktura składająca się z małych, beżowych oczek. 
Szybko skurczyła się do obrączki pozostawiając ładne krążki na ściankach. 

Zapach: Niezapomniany, wszechobecny aromat.
Jest tutaj wiele warstw wtajemniczenia.
Beczka po bourbonie wnosi intensywną woń czekolady, cukierków Kukułek, wanilii i przypalonego karmelu.
Tuż za nią podąża aromatyczna, mocno palona kawa.
Kroku również dotrzymują akcenty lodów śmietankowych, kakao, marcepanu i mokrej dębiny. Na ostatniej prostej dobiega cukier trzcinowy i melasa.
Zapach układa się w poszczególne warstwy i otwiera się z czasem jak kwiat.

Smak: Na języku, gładziutkie, jedwabiste już od pierwszego łyka.
W ustach rozpływa się mleczna czekolada, kakao, orzechy migdałowe, Nutella i przypalony karmel. Kawa ma słodki profil i umiarkowany stopień nut palonych.
Słodycz wafelków kokosowych, drewna dębowego oraz beczkowej wanilii wypełnia i głaszcze podniebienie.
Posmak cukierków Kopiko oraz Kukułek wypełnionych chrupiącym karmelem i czekoladą, przez długi czas utrzymuje się w ustach. Piwo chociaż ma wysoką pełnię i jest niezmiernie syte i treściwe, charakteryzuje się dość wyraźnym palonym finiszem.
Tekstura jak wcześniej już wspomniałem jest gęsta jak olej silnikowy.
Ukrycie procentów - arcymistrzowskie. 
Sama radość! Sztosiwo warte swojego hajpu! 

Wysycenie: Niskie.

Podsumowanie:

BBVSS uwodzi smakiem i powala aromatem. 
Kryje w sobie bogactwo różnorodnych nut smakowo-zapachowych. 
Profil beczkowy jest niezapomniany, chociaż kawa nie jest aż tak esencjonalna, jakbym się tego spodziewał. 
Balans i wielowarstwowość to dwie najważniejsze cechy tego trunku. 
Prawdopodobnie najlepsze piwo AleSmith i w 100%-ch najlepsze z serii Speedway Stout."

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Barrel-Aged Vietnamese Coffee,"(1, 64)",4.2,"650 ml bottle at Sander's place courtesy of Sander, many thanks! Pours a nearly black dark mahogany with a light brown head. Aroma of coffee, roasted malt, hazelnuts and caramel. Full body with a soft carbonation, a light to medium bitterness and a light to medium sweetness along with some noticeable alcohol. The flavor is similar to the aroma with more bourbon character, sweetish roasted malt, cocoa, dark chocolate and lots of mild coffee. Finishes with wood, bourbon, vanilla and some sweet roasted malt. Delicious!

The nose shows light acetic tones with light caramel and latte notes over restrained black coffee. Vanilla and bourbon notes become apparent upon opening up. 

The palate is thick bodied and lightly carbonated. Bourbon and latte forward but perfectly balanced without either flavor overcoming the other. An alcoholic prickly heat appears on the mid-palate followed by a lot of vanilla and lightly roasted coffee bitterness on the finish.

This was pretty much my most sought after beer. Absolutely loved the regular Vietnamese Coffee version (4.53) and expect this one to be the best beer I ever tried. That good. Was lucky enough to get a free pour while going to Emily’s birthday party. A huge thanks to Chris and Lesley for probably a huge tab. Rushed this, but here’s to heaven.

Poured a pitch black color with two fingers of frothy tan head when I got it. Very serene setting underneath the chaos. Excellent spotty lacing. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.25)

Smelled smooth buttery bourbon, milk chocolate syrup, cocoa, some malt chocolate, creamy espresso, vanilla, toffee and sweet caramel. (Smell - 4.75)

Wow on the taste. Still than milky chocolate syrup, malt chocolate, smooth bourbon, creamy vanilla, touch of oak, espresso, lactose and coffee creamer. (Taste - 4.75)

Full body. Creamy-to-sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth finish. (Feel - 4.75)

Just as awesome as I hoped it would be. So glad I got the chance to have it. Unfortunately I feel like I slightly overrated it a tad. (Overall - 4.75)

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Barrel-Aged Vietnamese Coffee,"(2, 28)",4.6,"Bottle from Himmeriget back in late March with Herr Angstmann. All Speedies are amazing, but this was something to behold. A bit more sweet and vanilla from the Vietnamese coffee, and a thinner body than the non-BA Speedies. The bourbon is almost overwhelming with its taste and heat but somehow backs off just enough to showcase all the other flavours. It is still smooth and very drinkable, marshmallow/brownie flavours competing with the coffee and smoky bourbon. I love it, one of my favorites."

The pour is a nice oily black with a thin head of dark khaki that falls to a ring, leaving no lace. The aroma is a huge chocolate bomb. It’s awesome. There is such a big chocolate malt presence. There is a strong barrel character as well. The bourbon is big and it does offer a nice addition of vanilla. The coffee is quite subdued, which I’m not that much of a fan of. The flavor is good, but lightly disappointing. The coffee again is lacking. The chocolate is big once more and the bourbon is nice. There is a strong woodiness to it that I just don’t care too much for. The head and chocolate balance well though. The mouth feel is a little light. It’s viscous, but you have to work the carbonation out and I’m not crazy about that. This one is good, but it’s not quite as good as some of the other BA variants. The aftertaste is chocolatey and malty and carries a little bourbon to it. It’s tasty"

La mousse dense élabore le début d’une dentelle. Le nez est exceptionnellement riche avec ses notes de caramel, de café, de sirop d’érable, de vanille, de chocolat, de fudge et de bourbon. Les saveurs sont superbes mais légèrement dominées par un bourbon teintée par le caramel et la vanille avec tout ce qu’il faut de notes maltées intenses et de café arrondi. Le corps m’apparaît moyen-fort avec une texture veloutée et un apport modéré des bulles. La finale se fait sur des notes de café et de chocolat bien secouées par un bourbon qui me semble être un peu piquant. Fantastique."

Partagée en compagnie de SlovakSniper lors d’une dégustation fortement anticipée! Dès la capsule sautée, de puissantes et envahissantes arômes de vanille, chocolat noir et bourbon. La vanille est telle et le café si délicat à la manière d’une vanille française. Une pointe d’épices également ajoute une touche de profondeur et de complexité des plus agréables. Les arômes se métamorphosent merveilleusement en saveurs en bouche en un superbe continuum des plus harmonieux. Texture soyeuse, la bière est ample quoique curieusement étroite en fin de bouche. Aucune amertume, même l’habituelle amertume de torréfaction n’est présente. Longue, douce, complexe et combien réconfortante!"

Nice medley of coffee and chocolate out of the gate. Simmers into oak, vanilla and fudge....and then the bourbon creeps in to take the sweetness of the edges. Great mouthfeel, thick but not chewy...seems the barrel thinned this out in comparison to the non-BA Vietnamese version I had.

>>> AleSmith strikes again with a wonderfully rich and balanced coffee imperial stout. The mouthfeel is out of this world. 



+  Like most Speedway variants, the beer is beautiful. Pitch black with a medium beige-brown head, very good retention and some lacing 

+  Flavors of coffee, caramel, vanilla, bourbon and even marshmallow are all very intense and deep, but at the same time they are totally cohesive and nothing is overpowering 

+  The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth, super silky and rich with a mild alcohol warmth at the end 

+  It’s on par with the best Speedway variants along the regular, the non barrel-aged Vietnamese one and the bourbon barrel-aged Speedway.

Full of fudge and ground coffee on the nose with lots of dough cream and a warming barrel appearance. Coffee is extremely well pronounced, revealing a flowery berry quality, gently wrapped up into fudge and charred malts. 

Drinks outstandingly smooth, very soft on the tongue with an intense barrel infusion, creating a hot bite during the finish, together with bitter coffee.

Tastes of sweeter fudge, immediately coated up by earthy, silk coffee with a faint berry quality to it. This foundation gets joined by a prominent, vanilla heavy, warming barrel, adding smoky oak, camp fire warmth, resin and a whiff of hazelnuts to the taste. Finishes with present, hot, dry bourbon among cream, coated by coffee and fudgy booze.

Features a full bodied beer, surprisingly fudgy, with flowery, berry infused ground coffee. Extremely smooth, almost easy drinking if it wasnt for the prominent barrel."

Drinking all of these side-by-side while becoming increasingly intoxicated drives home a few points. (1) they all pretty much taste the same -- I mean, the bourbon barrel versions are a little smoother with more bourbon/vanilla with the coffee in the background, but with the exception of regular Vietnamese I couldn’t telly you which of the many variants I was drinking without looking closely at the bottle. (2) that’s fine, though, because they’re all pretty tasty. BA Vietnamese doesn’t really capture the milky smoothness/sweetness of the non-barreled version, and tastes basically like (you guessed it) all the other BA Speedways."

Holy hell have I been waiting for this baby for a long time. Thanks Chris! The pour is a beautiful light orange-tinted golden yellow color with a thicker white head and a couple spots of lace as it falls down to a thin ring. The aroma is spectacular. There is a huge win aspect to it with a light citrus and a ton of stone fruit. I have no idea how this complexity comes, since this is a non-fruited saison. Oh my goodness. The flavor is equally spectacular. The fruitiness, the delicate wheat and light oak, a hint of spice to let you know it’s still a saison. The stone fruits and citrus remain at large, and I just don’t understand how good this is. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a big carbonation and a lingeringly tart and clean wine soaked citrus and stone fruit with a light zing of saison on the back end. Mother fucker."
Hill Farmstead / Blaugies Le Sarrasin,"(1, 16)",4.3,"The one and only Batch 1, 750mL bottle, drunk 1/19/17 at the brewery.
Light-to-minimal haze in this bronze-golden body with fiery copper hues. Well-carbonated, with a big, off-white head that steadily recedes to cover.
The nose strikes me with two things immediately: one, the tell-tale Hill Farmstead ""micro flora"", if you will, creating light acidity, strong minerality and dry, yellow fruits. And two, LOTS of buckwheat character, giving it an almost vegetal funk (very hard to describe). It’s extremely unique and interesting. Beyond that, light black pepper enters the mix alongside light lemon and soft Brett notes. Over the course of 45 minutes, it really softens and turns quite elegant and incredibly funky, neither becoming too acidic nor fruity. No alcohol nor flaw.
In the mouth it’s still tightly carbonated, though the levels seem much lower now and it adds a bit to the drinkability, leaving a bit of wateriness on the end. Dry, of course, with cereal-like character from the buckwheat adding almost a vegetal, corn, vanilla-like note which is snapped up by light brett and lactic acids. Tart and crisp on the finish with soft black pepper and a touch of oaky tannin.
Pretty god damned nice stuff; flavorful, even rich and intense at times yet with a drinkable, simple elegance, as well."
Hill Farmstead / Blaugies Le Sarrasin,"(1, 17)",4.2,"750 ml bottle to snifter, shared with the Mrs. tonight. Looks good; a cloudy mango with foamy eggshell head.

Robust and delicious."

Cloudy, but clearer than most HF beers. The aroma is quite nice, citrus, light acid, a little malt. Classic HF so far. The taste sets this apart and shows the pronounced Blaugies influence. The first sip is tart acidity but the finish is lots of hay, reminding me a traditional Belgian saison. I am more partial to the straight HF saison vs Belgian but this is still a very balanced and drinkable beer."

T: Nicely tart, a touch of malt though not sweet, perse.

M: Light body, prickly carbonation, hidden alcohol.

O: A very powerful sour that doesn’t quite hit all the high points of a bottle like Beatification for me. It’s quite good, but it doesn’t have the deep complexity I would prefer. Glad to have tried it."

Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate florals, citrus, lemon, funk, vinous notes, and faint oak. It pours cloudy dull yellow with a large white head that quickly fades to a thin film outlined by a slightly thicker ring. There are some nice soapy rings left on the sides of the glass. The flavor starts with a quick dose of citrus and tropical fruits. The finish has moderate-heavy sour lemon, light funk, and sour grapes. It’s light bodied with moderate carbonation.

Very slightly hazed golden color; mostly clear with several rapidly rising bubble streams, ending at the rich, fluffy white foam grouped on top. Lightly soapy, creamy, & long-lasting. Aroma is great. Lovely bit of dry cotton & farmhouse stall funk with touches of musty hay, dried & toasted wheat (buckwheat maybe?) mild green apple, a perfect touch of slightly tart stone fruit, & a hint of white grape. So clean, so balanced. Flavor is no different. Wow. Great melange of semi-tart & ever-so-slightly acidic fruits with each sip; peach, white grape, lemon, green apple. Background notes of toasted wheat & baked crackers with a perfect funky offset of post-rainstorm hay, straw, & barnyard floor. Touch of earthiness in the finish, ending with a nice combo of mineral & barnyard, a slight hint of stone fruits that linger into a mostly dry finish. Crisp, light, refreshing body. This is just ridiculous. Shaun’s ability to crank out saisons of this caliber is disgusting. Goddamn. Phenomenal stuff."

Hazy gold glow, large bubbled white head drops but lasts, lacing along whole glass. Phenols stronger than Flora, light egg alongside tons of dusty hay, cobweb with lasting dough. Citrus front palate, zesty with lightly peppery esters. Mid is thin, carbonation barely supports lemon and dough, thin stinging finish, zesty with more pepper, high carbonation. Pleasant and balanced, low complexity but very integrated.

Gorgeous opaque vibrant orange-straw colored pour, classic vivacious HF saison frothy head. Nose and flavor are just incredible; gigantic tangy lemon, doughy wheat and hearty grain character, hints of stone fruit like apricot and a bit of lychee, dry white wine alluding to solid acidity, and nuanced but prevalent vinous and tannic funk. Seems like they may have used Blaugies yeast, as the carb and mouthfeel seem a touch different from Shaun’s normal wine barrel saisons, but I could be imagining that. Either way, crisp, medium bodied, quenching, ultra dry, stunning. What a winner."

Taste is tart, fresh bready dough, lots of white wine, grape, lemon acidity, very tasty. The beer is extremely light on the tongue, the sparkling carbonation contributes to this fluffy effect and the finish is quite dry with an ever so slight curl of the tongue from the acidity. Delicious new age saison indeed, hope to drink this again."

The taste is refreshing and thin and yummy with notes of malts, graininess, tart lime, some lemon and a bit more slim grainy goodness that offer a thin oasis from the growing yet modest acidic notes. It really ties together at this point. It gets lemon and pineapple like at times. Wow! This just blends into refreshing yummy harmony."

Some nice, overripe stone fruit notes with some tropical fruit as well. Light white wine tannins with some light oak notes. Some light phenolic notes of grains of paradise and pink peppercorn. Pours a cloudy, yellow gold with a large, fluffy white head that displays nice retention. Moderately high lacing and faint legs. Flavor has a medium light tartness with a nice citrus character, though less lemon-lime and more lemon. Low orange notes. Some light white wine and oak character with some faint tannins. Medium low bitterness and light phenolics. A medium light buckwheat note in the background which adds some really nice complexity. Typical, nice Hill Farmstead water profile, soft but with some light mineral notes. Low stone fruit notes. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. Overall an amazing and delicious saison. The buckwheat adds a nice, light malt complexity. The acidity is well balanced and the oak tannins work well. Fruitiness and citrus are very good as well."
Hill Farmstead / Blaugies Le Sarrasin,"(1, 83)",4.1,"Sour smell. Taste is light sourness, a bit of saison character, and stone fruit skin."
Hill Farmstead / Blaugies Le Sarrasin,"(1, 84)",4.6,"Cloudy, dull gold. Big bubbly white head. Flavor is sour, leather, manure, tart, light oak, Chardonnay, lactic sourness. Oh. Hell. Yes."
Hill Farmstead / Blaugies Le Sarrasin,"(1, 85)",4.3,"My Bottom Line:

Surprisingly sour, this funky farmhouse brew also seduces through lean and bubbly mouthfeel, able to polish inherent rusticity to appreciable levels.



Further Personal Perceptions:

-A slice of foam covers the misty blond.

-I hadn’t expected this pungent a sourness.

-This is easily the most intense Blaugies brew I’ve had.

-Straw flavors are quite important as well.

Hill Farmstead / Blaugies Le Sarrasin,"(2, 21)",4.9,"Grabbed this bottle 2 weeks ago, $30 @ 2 per person, quite steep but when you compare it to the $20 375ML younger wild ales from so many breweries, it’s not a bad price. This is effectively a french wine barrel aged saison brewed using organic ingredients and spent up to 6 months bottle conditioning. Just my personal thoughts about the price. Anyway, this sat in my fridge for the 2 weeks since purchase and enjoyed 3 ways



A -  Gorgeous orange gold slight hazziness. 1 finger head fades to a thin line. Slightly sticky lacing. 



S - Nose is a huge wine bursting tart with a mild acidity of fresh oranges. Lots of citrus tart lovely I mean this nose is incredible. 



T -  Taste is challenging to describe. Super bright juicy ripe fruit, super tart and lively hearty but extremely well balanced between a wheat, light bitterness and lemon with an oaky vinous texture.



M - A mouthfeel that is thick and full of bubbly sparkling wine and the tartness resembled raspberry and honey. I don’t know what buckwheat tastes like but I would imagine the minor haze and chewy effervescent is due to that.



O - This s super drinkable! Really delicious and I’m glad I have a few of these to enjoy over the next year or so! Great work Blaugies and Hill Farmstead."

Appearance: Deep purple with really nice legs. 



Aroma: A good amount of alcohol at first, but it then settle down as it breathe. Vibrant fresh tart cherries presence with some spiciness, herbal notes and honeyed sweetness. 



Taste: Sweet, but almost perfectly balanced by the acidity and the tartness of the cherries. Here again the cherries are fresh and vibrants. Light to moderate spiciness, honey, a bit boozy and some herbal presence. 



Palate: Medium to full body. Syrupy. Dryer than expected with a nice warming finish from the alcohol and the light spices. Despite being somewhat dry, there’s still some lingering sweetness too (not cloying). 



Overall: This is a damn fine drink! A perfect sipper, except for the fact that it’s too drinkable. It’s probably nearly impossible to do a better job at showcasing the Schaarbeek cherries. Complex, warming and so tasty! The only ""bad"" thing I can say about this one is that, for the price, it’s certainly not 3-4 x better than Black Agnes (in fact I would say that Black Agnes is almost as good if not as good). Now I can’t wait to try Heart of Darkness. 



NOTE: It was as good if not better the day after we opened the bottle."

Schramm's The Statement Reserve,"(1, 39)",4.2,"500 mL bottle supplied by WillRunForBeer - many thanks! To tumbler, it pours a rosy crimson dark red. Aromas of marion berries, black cherries, charcoal, blueberries, graham cracker crusts, nutmeg, and black raspberries. Tastes the same with the addition of mint honey (I know this ingredient was not used), caramel apples, and blueberry mixed drink. Kickable, but smooth; I ignorantly assumed this would be syrupy as hell, but, Jesus, is this a wonderfully juicy mead. Bravo!"

Schramm's The Statement Reserve,"(1, 41)",4.6,"This is a blood red, purplish color with really nice legs. Nose is actually really interesting. It smells almost too fresh, boozy, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. it’s actually a very herbal nose followed by the definitive cherry nose. The taste is quite excellent. Really nice almost no booze, great sweetness that matches well with the sour cherries certainly a top tier cherry used in this beer. The only flaw is that at the finish, I get a faint latex glove,plastic taste. I can only hope that fades with time. Super drinkable. this is not a mead, this is some next level jamba juice gone organic w/ god tears."

Schramm's The Statement Reserve,"(1, 50)",4.3,From bottle at Schramm’s. Pour is deep ruby with no head. Aroma and flavor are huge cherry with some added notes of honey and oak. Finish is sweet cherry juice. So much cherry that the 14% abv is almost masked completely. Unreal.
Schramm's The Statement Reserve,"(1, 51)",4.4,"Tap @ Schramm’s: Rich, indigo body with a pink-ish, red-ish tint; hard to pinpoint an exact color. As with most of Ken’s meads, completely still with no carbonation. Aroma is insane. Gushing with ripe cherries lathered in a sweet honey bath. So juicy, so fresh, so pure; you get the sweetness of the flesh layered with the light tart-acidic aspect of the skins; a mild sharp, spicy tone with a strong, honey finish. The taste is incredible. Lovely combination of both sweet & tart. Fresh, ripe cherries & cherry juice, bursting with flavor. Underlying notes of sweet honey, warm cinnamon, & just a touch of vinous booze towards the back-end. Aftertaste lingers with a macerated cherry & sweet honey glaze that coats your palate for days. Incredible mead. Ken Schramm for president."
Schramm's The Statement Reserve,"(1, 52)",4.5,Sample pour at Schramm’s. Deep ruby color. Aroma is rich cherry syrup. Tastes incredible. Like liquid cherry pie.

I would drink this all the time if the price tag was reasonable.
Schramm's The Statement Reserve,"(1, 53)",4.7,"Pours a deep ruby. Aroma is so intense. Rich sweet cherry, light swimming in a vat of juice. Flavor is even more intense. Full rich cherry.

Ken does it again.....and again......and again......!"

Schramm's The Statement Reserve,"(1, 55)",4.7,"750ml bottle #12/36 shared by jrallen34, thanks dude!



Pours bright red, glowing, a ton of legs on this mead, beautiful. The sweetness of the honey and cherries is blended to perfection. I don’t think there’s any possible way for this to taste any better. A mix between a port and a wine, unlike anything I’ve had before. Tons of sweet cherries, light tartness, honey sweetness, not cloying at all. No alcohol presence at all.



Wow am I sad I don’t have one of these bottles. This stuff is just unreal...dare I say better than Heart of Darkness."

Z kranu do butelki na wynos 0,5 l, Kufle i Kapsle Wwa. Piana jasnobrązowa, niezbyt obfita, drobnopęcherzykowa, ładnie krążkuje. Jak na taką zawartość alkoholu jest dość trwała, obrączka pozostaje praktycznie do końca. Piwo jest koloru głębokiej czerni, całkowicie nieprzejrzyste. Aromat intensywny, dominuje w nim szlachetna alkoholowość, likierowość, paloność, kawa i trochę gorzkiej czekolady. W smaku mimo potężnego ciała jest dość wytrawne, mocno palone. Na pierwszym planie ponownie intensywna paloność, kawa, szlachetna alkoholowość, do tego trochę deserowej czekolady. Pełnia jest wysoka, wysycenie niskie, goryczka średnio wysoka, o charakterze palono-alkoholowym. Trunek jest gęsty i treściwy, pozostawia długi posmak kawy i paloności, przyjemnie rozgrzewa gardło. Jedyna rzecz, którą uznałbym za wadę to ciut za mocna alkoholowość. Mimo to, choć do tamtej pory nie piłem zbyt wielu risów, mogę stwierdzić, że to dla mnie piwo wybitne, bardzo bogate i złożone. 4,5/5"

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"(2, 14)",3.6,"Bottle at home during CL match Ajax Juve. For me the match was better than the beer, I am sad to conclude. The beer had very fruity elements to the coffee which I don’t really appreciate, neither in smell nor in taste. The bitterness is there but overall it lacks the fullness and other flavors to make this a balanced and convincing effort. I find it hard to believe that what I had in my bottle is a top 50 beer. To each his own I guess or the trip didn’t do it good."

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"(2, 18)",4.3,"2 finger mocha coloured head.
Pitch black beer.

Aroma is specialty coffee, dark rye bread, dark chocolate, oats, toffee, hint of red berries, vanilla and toasted oak in a fantastic blend.

Taste is cappuccino, complex espresso, light coconut, oats, dark chocolate, vanilla, crema, charred oak and a light fruity note from the coffee.

Mouthfeel is unbelievably smooth with a perfect medium-low, soft carbonation. Very drinkable without ever feeling thin and while retaining a creamy feel. Plump body. Medium bitterness. Amazing pastry stickiness. Only small hints of alcohol (and they suit the beer) at this ABV, which is pretty ridiculous. This is how you do it. 

Overall: Thanks to BierCab Barcelona's amazing bottleshop, I finally managed to get ahold of this beauty. This is worthy of the hype! I do think it gets a tad bit too sweet at times and then too roasty at times, so the optimal balance isn't there but that is a bad case of nitpicking honestly. Fantastic brew."

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"(2, 23)",4.3,"Wygląd: pwio jest czarne, nieprzejrzyste, o ładnej wysokiej drobno-pęcherzykowej pianie. W zapachu zdecydowanie kawa, często dodatek kawy w risie sprawia, że aromat idzie w mocno espresso, natomiast tutaj czuć przyjemną kawowość. Następnie wyczuwam nuty przypalonego toffi, ciemnych owoców (daktyle, rodzynki), troszkę gorzkiej czekolady. Aromat jest bardzo złożony. W smaku dominuje gorzka czekolada, wspomagane przez kawę, paloność jest średnio-wysoka, ale przyjemna kawowa, pozostająca na podniebieniu. Piwo jest bardzo gładkie, alkohol niewyczuwalny, brakuje mu nieco ciała. Bardzo porządny stout bez wad, ale też bez szaleństw. W każdym calu bardzo dobry, ale niczym nie wyróżniający się."

Aroma: I would give it a solid 4/5. Roasty and full of malt scent. Full body and thick. 
Appearance: Dark brown color with off-white head. Great retention. 4.25/5
Flavor: great roasty malt flavor, a bit more on the dry side compared to some stout. Better than standard. 4.25/5
Mouthfeel: I think drinking at tap in its own brewery helps. Full body and smooth, creamy with different layers of taste. Carbonation is spot on. With CO2, this beer is still very smooth. Not as smooth as the nitro stouts, but the CO2 retention is great (of course). 4.5/5

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"(2, 38)",4.2,"Bottle. Pours an opaque brown-black with a shallow creamy beige head that fades relatively quickly to a cinnamon ring. Nose is coffee, chocolate, roasted pecans, smoke, and dark wood; very nice, and incredibly well integrated. Nothing stands out, everything is present. On the tongue -- that is simply the best textured Imperial Stout I have ever had. Silken doesn't do it justice. Velvet is closer. The taste is coffee, chocolate, and a very strong punch of smoked meat -- it's almost brisket-like in its heartiness. It's almost too much, but not quite; but that is a LOT of smoke. I'll be honest, I don't find it the be-all and end-all other people make it out to be, but it's damned good."

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"(2, 45)",5,"Speedway Stout is now available in 16-oz cans. I'd rather open the smaller quantity, because if I do not finish what I open it will go bad on me. But here is a caution if you open a can: Your beer will taste better if you drink it from a glass. I think the reason is you get more aroma from a glass than from the tiny opening in a can. The 16-oz version really does taste just as good as the 22- oz version, but only from a glass."

Taste is chocolate milk, roast, hints of coffee and sweet licorice, caramel comes through in the finish, along with huge chocolate notes again. The essential imperial stout."
AleSmith Speedway Stout,"(2, 65)",4.3,"2016 vintage. Appearance: deep dark brown/Black, opaque, with a low lying khaki head and nice lacing
Aroma: All malt, with rich dark chocolate, toffee, caramel, and light roast
Taste: Rich dark chocolate with a light toffee and roast. Beautifully balanced with just enough bitterness to balance
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a light creaminess and a light carbonation 
Finish: Roasted malt and bitterness lingers on the finish with a touch of dark chocolate 
Overall: Beautifully balanced for an imperial story with coffee. Profile is insanely smooth throughout, from aroma thru the finish. Dark chocolate and toffee are most prevalent, but a lightly roasted coffee note balances while remaining smooth. A light creaminess tonthe body helps blend the flavors together. This beer has 2 years of age, and stands upbas a top notch imperial stout"
AleSmith Speedway Stout,"(2, 66)",4.7,"Beautiful nougat colored persistent foam. Pleasant aroma of chocolate, coffee and a little licorice. There is dark bitter chocolate that is the main theme of this Imperial Stout, but in the aftertaste, it also develops a bit of bitter espresso coffee and a little English licorice as well as sweet hints of vanilla. The carbonation is soft and contributes to a good full taste in the mouth where all its fine shades of chocolate and coffee last for a long time."
AleSmith Speedway Stout,"(2, 67)",4.6,"Can. Color: Black, light brown head. Aroma: Coffee, mocha, lightly alcohol. Taste: Darkoasted malt, strong notes of coffee and mocha, hints of molasses. Medium sweet, moderate bitter. Soft carbonation, bit creamy, full body. Slightly boozy at finish, bit warming mouthfeel. Great coffee Imperial Stout. I love it."
AleSmith Speedway Stout,"(2, 68)",5,I could drink this beer every single day of my life!! This has to be one of the best imperial stouts of all time. Coffee lovers would also appreciate the smell and aroma's bubbling up from the depths of the bottom of the glass. Even if you dont like beer you would be tempted to press your lips against the cool black glass
AleSmith Speedway Stout,"(2, 69)",4.3,"The beer has got a deep black colour with a steady head and smooth body.  Aroma of dark chocolate and coffee. Taste of warm coffee, roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate,  plums, barrel and cream. Smooth delicious finish."

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"(2, 72)",4.1,"Smells like Coors light, but somehow worse. Also there is a pungent urine like aroma. Other than that, this beer is amazing - it was as if I was drinking diamonds. Malty rich initial sensation, followed by a smooth taste of coffee and rye with a silky vanilla after taste. Pours black like Guinness, with a slightly shorter head. Purchased a tall boy."
AleSmith Speedway Stout,"(2, 73)",4.5,"No light through, tan head. Nose is cherries coffee, and coco. The first impression across the tongue is powerful; fudge, coco nibs, esspresso, dark roasted chocolate malt, and currants with caramel. Finish shows a little booze, but wraps the tongue once again in a vhocolate, coffee, and malt blanket. One of the best deserts I have ever had. Seriously."

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"(2, 83)",4.4,"Finally got a can on my last trip to Vermont. A bit hard to get find in Canada. Pours an average size frothy creamy tan head and has a deep dark black appearance with some amber highlights. Decent sticky lacing. Alcohol smell is instantly noticeable. Aromas of dark roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, cocoa, some subtle notes of dry fruit, vanilla, a bit of resin. Flavours are also abundant, mostly with the chocolate and dark roasted malts, the usual coffee and cocoa are there as well. A little bit of a bourbon like finish on the palate. Smooth, slick and slightly oily mouthfeel. The alcohol is nicely hidden and just slightly noticeable, much more than aroma. Gets a little smokey the longer it sits, which is great. Should've picked up a few more cans, maybe next time. :P"

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"(2, 88)",4.5,"2017 edition can. Pours pitch black with a one finger and half thick tan head.
Roasted coffee beans and vanilla aroma, not too powerful to be honest.
Taste is rich of flavours, very sweet but not sickening. Lots of vanilla, dark chocolate, some anise with a nice light bitter roasted finish with subtle burnt burnt caramet notes. Alcohol totally hidden.
Fantastic mouthfeel, thick, oily, sticky.
One of the best Imperial Stout around I had."
AleSmith Speedway Stout,"(2, 89)",4.2,"Sysitumma lasissa, ei juuri vaahtoa. Vahva ja täyteläinen tuoksu. Paahdetta, suklaisuutta, alkoholia ja hieman kahvia. Maku ja suutuntuma ovat paksuja sekä pitkäkestoisia. On maltaita, kahvia, karamellia ja sopivasti alkoholin puraista. Pehmeä, öljyinen tunne jää suuhun. Loistava IS, yksi parhaista."
AleSmith Speedway Stout,"(2, 90)",4.5,"Bottle conditioned. Speedway Stout’s ominous, pitch-black appearance has become a hallmark of this modern-day classic. Chocolate and roasted malts dominate the flavor, supported by notes of dark fruit, toffee, and caramel. A healthy dose of locally-roasted coffee from Ryan Bros. Coffee, Inc. added to each batch brings out the beer’s dark chocolate flavors and enhances its drinkability. Despite its intensity, Speedway Stout’s fine carbonation and creamy mouthfeel make it very smooth and surprisingly easy to drink. This beer ages very well and will continue to mature for many years to come.

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"(2, 91)",5,"La siniestra apariencia negra de Speedway Stout se ha convertido en un sello distintivo de este clásico moderno. Las maltas de chocolate y tostadas dominan el sabor, respaldadas por notas de fruta oscura, toffee y caramelo. Una dosis saludable de café tostado localmente de Ryan Bros. Coffee, Inc. agregado a cada lote resalta los sabores de chocolate negro de la cerveza y mejora su capacidad de beber. A pesar de su intensidad, la carbonatación fina y la boca cremosa de Speedway Stout lo hacen muy suave y sorprendentemente fácil de beber. Esta cerveza envejece muy bien y seguirá madurando durante muchos años más."
AleSmith Speedway Stout,"(2, 92)",5,"AleSmith has the best collection of  beers I think I’ve ever had. And Speedway is a major reason. If you like Stouts this is your choice. Not only is it a great stand-alone beer, it is also the base for some of the best riffs on a “standard” ...whether it’s their barrel aged, coffee,  or other flavors, I’ve never been disappointed with a Speedway...except when the glass is empty."
AleSmith Speedway Stout,"(2, 93)",4.2,"Excellent stout! It has the deep and warm body you'd expect, very coffee and roasted flavour with a nice undertone of smoke. It has a beatiful appearance with very deep black and nice thin layer of foam. A true classic."
AleSmith Speedway Stout,"(2, 94)",4.3,"Can. Black, smaller unstable brown head. Bose basically a Christmas pudding (booze, dates, vanilla, prunes, caramel) with loads of coffee over that.

AleSmith Speedway Stout,"(2, 95)",4.3,"Glad to see this one in a 16 oz can, since it's fantastic and 16 oz is about as much as I can take. It's a motor oil beer and has a great sweet flavor to mix with coffee. I wish they'd start selling them in 4-packs."

Probably not in my top 10 from these guys but still epic juice."

Delicate, incredibly dry, long finish. An amazing combination of green grape skins, chardonnay, yeast, hay, straw, light oak, light apricots and peach, somewhat herbaceous and then incredibly dry. Moderate carbonation and full body, dries out with flavours further developing revealing more deliciousness. On top of that easily drinkable. Great beer."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(1, 8)",4.7,"*5/27/2014
750ml bottle poured in a Hill Farmstead taster. (bottle share)

A~ super hazy glowing yellow, not much of a head, and no lacing at all.

S~ tons of fermented honey, white grapes, vinegar and white wine. super strong acidity unlike any brew i’ve ever smelt.

T~ wow! this is crazy unique! pretty much follows the nose with more saison aspects. black pepper and bready yeast. all ending with a strong lemon vinegar tartness.

M~ not very carbonated but thats probably because the sample was saved for me. otherwise super smooth with the texture of dank lemonade. if this was freshly cracked i’m sure this would have had a nearly perfect score.

O~ definitely the most unique brew i’ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing! i’m hoping this is still being done again but i’m sure it won’t be the same, this is just too crazy! hopefully its the same kind of wine barrel as well, the white wine/grape aspect is unreal! i seriously hope to have another chance to try this, 2 ounces was not enough!

EDIT FOR BATCH 2:
a lot brighter and way more citrus than batch 1. honey and white wine still very forward. so delicate and amazing all around!

EDIT FOR BATCH 3:
just wow! everything you could love about Ann is here! i had to rate this higher!"

 And then this:

Yup, that’s a magnum of Ann. 

It was an experience that transcended beer and life itself. Poured at the Hill Farmstead 7th anniversary week on Saturday. Spilt with some very generous and very hungover bros who I’ve never met before and will probably never see again. It was a perfect medley of honey, wine and funk that was more than the sum of its parts. Shared against the backdrop of the Vermont countryside, it was ethereal in every sense. It was too perfect for you to understand without being there yourself...without the setting, it doesn’t get a 5. Without the magnum it doesn’t get a 5. Without the people I shared it with, it doesn’t get a 5. But...put all those together and you have perfection. In every sense. Without apology and without reservation, this beer is the greatest thing ever brewed, bar none."

Hill Farmstead Ann,"(1, 44)",4.6,"Batch 1 and 2 side by side from a bottle. 
Aroma is very nice with some light stone fruit and pineapple notes. A moderate herbal funk to it with some light oak. Batch 1 is more oaky with some honey notes to it. 
Batch 1 pours a slightly orange while batch 2 is a hazy straw color. Both have moderate sized, thick, white head that shows nice retention. Medium light lacing and small legs. 
Flavor is delicate with nice light acidity. Light stone fruit, melon and pineapple notes. A light herbal note with light oak notes. Batch 1 has a lot more honey notes with some light spiciness. Delicate, soft water notes with light bitterness. 
Mouthfeel is soft and medium light bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a very nice Saison. Very delicate and balanced with nice fruit and herbal notes. Balanced. I would probably deduct .3 or .4 from this score for batch 1."

Hill Farmstead Ann,"(1, 46)",4.8,"bottle shared at the Moeder Lambic cellar session 2015. 2015 batch bottle. drank side by side with anna. poured a beautiful pale cloudy dark honey colour with a nice white lacing on top. wich kept a lacing on the side of the glass forever. the appearance was like a complete different beer compared to anna. the smell i sout of this world. notes of that clear hill farmstead yeast, white grapes, white wine, oak, melons, sweetness of the honey, sweet citrus, peach, sweet earthe stone fruit pits, sweet pineapple, barnyard, and summer cut grass. the taste was even better as the aroma, it is so incredile full bodied. that anna even tasted weak compared to this. all layered perfectly together, with the sweetness of the honey, the clear wine barrels, and the citrus fruit.some grainy malts, and a small tart kick to the end. it is really smooth. this was everything i was hoping for it would be. this will be hands down the best saison that i would ever drink. the hype is real. this was so great to try. and i’m really glad i had to chance to drink this! lovely all the way"
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(1, 47)",4.7,"Bottle picked up at Hill Farmstead last February and shared at my wedding on 9/12/15. Pour was a slightly hazy blonde, lively eggshell head that breaks into gorgeous lace and remains throughout. Aromas are very inviting! Notes of oak, vanilla, light honey sweetness, light barnyard funk, medium floral and light earth. Taste is phenomenal! Such a balance of flavors throughout. Less honey and less Brett than the base beer, Anna.....but was a wonderful transformation through the barrel inflection. Nice rounded tartness gives off light hints of underripe apples and grapes...vinous and earthy in the mid-palate. Very much to my liking!! Light funk pushes through the back-end where the honey emerges in harmony with oak/vanilla to counter nicely. Finishes semi-dry, semi-sweet and lightly tart. Wonderful, wonderful beer....for a wonderful, wonderful night!"
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(1, 48)",4.6,"May 2014 Magnum shared by Adam C on 7/25/15.
Hazy burnished copper with a good amount of fairly well-retained white head atop.
Brightness of Anna lightly dulled, but in the best way possible, replacing it with soft lactic acids. Again more of the floral-sulfur-grass thing going on (that’s my closest approximation to describing the aroma of these wonderful saisons, and it’s admittedly terrible and sounds unappealing, but I’ll work on it once I get a whole bottle to myself....). Bits of honey on the end are just begging you to drink it.
Very well-restrained on the barrel character, compared to Art. Bright acidity, wildflower notes producing the same light stickiness. As it progresses, you get a pineapple-near-the-rind sort of flavor that is nicely dry but still has some good tartness and a pinch of sweetness. Bits of vanilla and light wood with some juicier melon notes. Hard to describe, these beers of Shawn’s. The flavors are all so new to me and it’s overwhelming to try them all for the first time this weekend. I can say that the mouthfeel, balance and attenuation are perfect here once again.
2014 375mL drunk 5/26/17 at the brewery.
Was really hoping to try the 2016 batch but they ONLY had the 2014.  DAMN.  Life is hard.
Still smells wonderful; tons of tart acidity, spicy phenols and floral character from the honey with very soft oak and rich honeyed malt tones through it all.  Very clean and much more gentle than when fresh.
Soft and very easygoing in the mouth with a lingering honey-like sweetness, soft wood tannins and lots of grass, juicy pineapple and melon.  The carbonation is very low at this point and maybe the 375mLs haven’t aged as gracefully as the larger format bottles, as this is just a touch tired (I wouldn’t continue aging these small bottles more than a year and would definitely drink them now), though certainly still highly enjoyable.  Bright acidity on the very end still helps enliven things but the tight, almost champagne-like carbonation that make Shaun’s sours so delightful is no longer very present here."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(1, 49)",4.4,"Magnum poured by Adam, bottled 2014, sold in 2015. Great bright gold color, spotty lace. Aroma is just a dream, honey, grain, citrus, very mild barrel. 


Can the barrel be anymore integrated?? The mouthfeel is soft and delicate just like every other of Mr. hill’s brew. Wow, the wine barrel is here but really mild. The honey, citrus and grain has a juicy like texture. Light floral hints, damn... The mouthfeel is crisp and lively, nice tingle. No hype just straight flavor."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(1, 50)",4.4,"Magnum shared by AdanChandler, opened at Ratebeer Farmhouse Magnum Tasting v1. Bottled 5/14. Pours yellow gold with s big white head. Aroma is oak, white wine, mild HFS funk. Super soft, with white grape, lemon, HFS funk."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(1, 51)",4.6,"Bottle: 2015 batch from a magnum thanks to Adam. Clear golden pour, soapy & foamy white head. Aroma is absolutely lovely. Big white wine character with light tartness & tannins that remain restrained. Light honey, wet oak, apple, lemon, hint of peach, kiwi, a small touch of soft mineral water, slight kick of farmhouse on the back end. Amazing flavor. White grape, honey, tart melon, lemon rind, kiwi, some soft grains. So smooth & mellow. Finishes with peach, lime, white grape, & a little kick of oaky tannins. This is a fucken fantastic beer that has lived up far beyond the hype. Incredible."

Hill Farmstead Ann,"(1, 53)",4.5,"Originally reviewed 10/26/2012. 750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Batch 1 bottle #98. Hazy with a white head. Good retention and lacing. Smells like Anna with wine. Honey and yeasty as hell. Light wine notes and a touch of acidity. Stronger wine presence in the taste. Really quite dominant. Lots of honey still, which cuts the yeastiness more than in Anna. Dry with a little brett. Gets fruitier towards the finish. A touch of grainy malts. Wonderful. Slick from the wine. Light and medium carbonation. Very nice. Low acidity, but it’s there and helps to bring the honey and wine together. Yeasty bitterness. I know there’s a lot of hype with this beer, but I have to admit that this is one of the best saisons I’ve ever had. Complex, light, and never overbearing with any one flavor. Truly a great saison."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(1, 54)",4.2,"Bottle, courtesy of kermis. Pours a hazy golden beer with a a big white head on top. Aroma is woody, barnyard, vineous touches, rather yeasty and some slight notes of peppery yeasts in there. Flavor is very funky, vineous, loads of fruity notes in there as well. Some raisins or something. A very nice, well balanced saison, certainly very nice, but not getting all the hype here."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(1, 55)",4.6,"Bottle shared at LBT2. Pours cloudy golden with a white head. Aroma is vinous with good oaky barrel notes, light floral notes, honey, citrus, a soft funk, fruits and grapes. Flavour is light moderate sweet with a touch or sourness. Perfectly balanced in the palate with a minerally fruitiness, soft acidity and wonderful barrel notes complimenting an already great base beer. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Overall, a technically perfect beer and the best saison I’ve had. A beer like this with such crazy hype, rarity and value can never really live up to it. It’s not worth what it takes to acquire, but still a beautiful beer and a great experience."

Hill Farmstead Ann,"(1, 60)",5,"Batch 2 bottle, split two ways. Poured into a wine stem. Appearance is crystal clear yellow-orange with finger of frothy, white head. Some lacing, and the head dissipates to a rim after a few minutes. Aroma is fresh honey, white wine, lemon. Some floral aspects, and a hint of funk. Taste is incredible. A deep honey flavor, minus the sweetness associated with it. White wine, lemon, juicy ripe white peaches, champagne, and drying oak. As it opens up, the white peach and champagne become prominent. Palate is delicate and complex. Many layers all complimenting perfectly. Juicy, but with a delicate dry finish. Overall, this is a truly exceptional beer. The care and effort that went into creating this are obvious. Well done, Shaun!"

A - pours a nice hazy golden honey with very little off white micro bubbled head and almost no lacing. S - metallic notes lead the nose into a musty horse blanket. The citrus and pineapple juice really shine through here. Oaky white wine tannins and dusty Brett characteristics. Really really nice aromas. M - very little carb. A nice rounded medium bodied. Creamy mouthfeel. A little tart and nicely dry. T - a nice fruit forward saison. Ruby red grapefruit and canned pineapple juice lead the way. Key lime juice and blood orange fruit and pith. The palate rolls away into the honey and nice very quietly spiced saison yeast, astringent and dusty. Almost bretty. Some subtle spices and nice lime juice with quiet metallic tinges, to end.

Pours pale orange, slightly hazy, white head rests partially on the surface, creamy ring of lacing around the glass. Aroma is round honey, soft hay, mild tangerine, white grape, vanilla and vinous oak, lovely. Taste is mildly sweet, with pear, honey, white grape, musty wheat, vinous with vanilla and oak. Becomes more rustic and funky with warmth, takes on almost a lambic-like quality. Medium light body, round and creamy, smooth, soft and balanced. Without a doubt superb."

Hill Farmstead Ann,"(1, 71)",4,"Woodshed 2.0. Yellow waxed 750mL bottle share courtesy of dak. It pours with an opaque pale gold body with copper hues and a near white head of foam. The aroma offers up sweaty socks, smooth soft vinegar, muted sugar coated spicy oak, apples and apricots. Smells very inviting. The taste is smooth yet mildly tart heading into smooth soft sour vinegar, apricot, pineapple and faint moldy spicy oak. The vinegar shows up now and then but is smooth, modest in strength and has a softness to it that really gives the experience extra depth and interest. Tasty rich stuff."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(1, 72)",4.3,"In short: An uber-rustic, oaky and honeyed blond Saison.  Elegant, complex, excellent.

How: Bottle 750ml, thick yellow bee wax.  Consumed 5 months after the beer release.  First batch (only batch so far).  Bottle #258.

The look: Cloudy blond body topped by a medium off-white head with good retention.
 
In long: Nose is very rustic, quite oaky and also a bit honeyed.  Overall very bright and clean nose that is a bit like Anna but with extra rusticity and oaky notes.  Taste starts with very nice crisp cereals, slightly honeyed and with a fresh hay sensation.  There’s a nice oak presence that is not overdone.  Also lemon zest, oaky white wine, a strong rustic yeast presence that doesn’t go into wild/brett territory, a fun cobweb sensation.  Dry oaky finish with the rusiticy shining.  A beer that is both nourishing and refreshing.  Superb mouthfeel with a full body and a lively carbonation.  The world that kept coming back to my mind was “elegant”.  Extremely pleasant to drink, this is almost a thirst beer which is very unusual for such a highly rated beer, high scores on ratebeer are usually reserved for high-intensity beers.  Hill Farmstead are brewing the best Saisons on the planet, no doubt about this anymore, and with a Saison lineup that includes Arthur, Art, Flora, Vera Mae, Civil Disobediences and more, I only rank Ann as a slightly above average Hill Farmstead Saison.  I’d like to get a few more bottles, but unfortunately finding a bottle of Ann just by asking around is as unlikely as catching a fish just by standing next to a lake going “fishy, fishy fishy...""."

One of my favorite beers ever, especially fresh. What an elegant treat."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(1, 77)",4,"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip.  From notes.

Ann has a great cloudy golden straw appearance with a fluffy white cap.

The aroma is full of honey, white grapes, straw, and pale malts, with the microflora, pear, and lemon zest taking a bit of a backseat.

My first sip starts out nicely sweet with honey and light malts.  White grapes and pear add a little bit of fruit character to the sweetness.  Straw, grass, and a mineral presence come in later on, followed by a spicy oak note, with the finish ultimately being dry and clean.

Ann has a slightly heavier body than Anna does with a little bit less carbonation, but overall it still has a medium body with a moderate level of crisp carbonation.  There is a bit of a zesty tartness that will probably continue to develop over time.  It is fairly dry.

Even someone who does not go crazy for saisons has to appreciate the quality of a beer like this.  The original beer is delicate and complex, and the aging process has only added to the character."

Aroma of subtle lemon, wheat, light citrus, hint of white pepper, slight funk and floral notes. The most delicate mouthfeel I have ever experienced, my notes actually say ""it’s like eating a newborn baby"", yup the palate was that delicate. Flavor also had a delicate feel about it. It was almost like if you used to much pressure to swallow that the beer would berak apart. Very floral overall with notes of lemon, citrus juice, very slight white wine, yeast, cask wood. Great stuff and still amazed by the palate on this one."

I could smell the beeswax for days nice little touch.

Bottle poured a hazy yellow with tight carbonation bubbles which lasted throughout my taste. Nose was strong white wine, from the barrel aging.  Taste was bright, citric, slightly floral with a sweet(honey) dry white wine finish.

Overall this was good but not my favorite by HF and I certainly wouldnt go through the lengths or trade what I did for this bottle again.  From what I hear, it was much better fresh.  Never the less I am extremely appreciative of Joey for opening his bottle and will look to trade mine for something that we can both enjoy."

Hill Farmstead Ann,"(1, 86)",4.2,"Bottle #260. Thanks Shaun. Enjoyed at 55 Degrees F in a snifter on my GF’s birthday. 



A - The beeswax surrounding this bottle smells amazing. The best smelling bottle I’ve ever had.  Gorgeous clarity. Bright golden orange with a  3 finger fluffy solid white head. Head fades to a finger and remains. Pillow-like lacing sticks decently.  A very nice steady stream of bubbles travel bottom to top for as long as I’m drinking it. Looks a lot like a Prosecco.



S - Grape skins and lemongrass on the nose. Lots of characters that remind me of Prosecco and Sauvignon Blanc. Lovely citrus and wine tannins and a splash of honey sweetness.



T - Very sweet like lemon, tangerines and grapefruit. Dash of wine tannins at the finish with a super dry finish. I don’t pick up a lot of honey but there is this tart wild yeast aspect that compliments the excellent wheat and grassiness.



M - Medium body and a very nice balanced medium carbonation. A hint of an astringent listerine mouth wash finish but it’s not drastic and you really have to swish quite a bit to get it.



O - Hype, Hype, Hype. So Ann, the elusive Ann. Her? I’m enjoying drinking this right now. It’s tasty and enjoyable but I prefer Art which, for most purposes, is the best beer to compare with Ann. Juicy, Mimosa and Flora, in my opinion, exceed Ann in taste, body and the nose. Art is still the definite winner of Hill Farmstead Barrel Aged farmhouse ales. Would I pick up Ann again? OF COURSE! It’s delicious and delicate and graceful throughout. However, the best saison I’ve ever had? Sorry but it’s not. Try this if you can. It’s a fantastic beer! Thanks Shaun."

The flavor is less on the saison character and more on sweet honey and tartness. The tartness compliments the honey nicely. Light to moderate mouthfeel, light carbonation, gentle tartness, and a mOderate finish. A good beer, not the be all end all beer that everyone has been making it out to be. It’s a pleasant drinker, especially on a muggy summer day. With that said, I’d have a hard time pulling the trigger on trading the beers this is going for."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 4)",4,"Aroma of this beer is lovely - soft and subtle with notes of honey, white grapes, soft yeast.  Looks beautiful, clear yellow with white foam.  Taste is pleasant.  The barrel aging has softened the sharp saison yeast and given the beer a mellow subtle character.  White wine/grapes, and a hint of sourness on the finish.  Excellent saison, but not the best beer I’ve ever had."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 5)",4.4,"Bottle shared by the other Matt tonight. Thanks! Beer served in a Tired Hands glass because I don’t bring my Hill Farmatead glass. At the time of this review this is #1 on the ""Top beers - Saison"" list on beeradvocate and is #18 on the ""Top Beers - Popular"". 

I got a later pour of this beer but saw others. The beer is yellow, straw clear but with a poorly settled yeast that fills the bottom pours with a cloudy white haze. The higher pours are clear and crisp yellow. Wispy white head of small bubbles, some retention, mild carbonation. Looks good. Also the bottle looks really nice. The beeswax really adds to the overall beer. 

Aroma is the best part. Super complex. At times I can smell a vinous white wine quality, saison yeast, honey, flowers, other times pineapple and Brett c breaks through. Very wonderful smelling beer. 

This beer has it all. Seriously. The honey character falls out slightly for me and it is close to perfect. The body is light and airy. Sweet with a yeasty funk mild oakiness with some grape and softer sweet fruits. The finish is thin but not overly dry. I really loved it and would of course have this beer again. This breaks into my top 50 beers of all time. A near perfect work of brewing art. Nice beer Shaun."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 6)",3.9,"top 50 ticked again... nice aroma of sour, crisp honey, floral notes... the taste has a sour bite on the end, dandelions, honey... quite good"
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 7)",4,"Pours a golden yellow with a nice white fizzy head, thick collar, bubbles, thin cap, spotty lace. Nose is citrus zest funk, tart acidic notes, oak. Really refreshing for a hot summer day. Flavor is citrus, grass, oak, lots of funk, some honey sweetness in there perhaps as well. Finish is a bit off-putting and a little harsh, some medicinal aftertaste mixed with some funky yeast notes. Light body, perfect carbonation, refreshing. 

Overall, a really cool beer from HF that I enjoyed very much. Really refreshing, nice and tart, and easy to drink. Good stuff. 

---Rated via I'm awesome and you're not."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 8)",4,"Great funky, citrus nose, hint of dandelions; honey, hint of funk and lemon; weird potent finish; good carb, but not super drinkable. Give me Anna instead."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 9)",4.3,"750mL bottle #99 out of 300 or so. Thanks to GT2 and Travlr for sharing. Appearance is golden with a big, fluffy, white head. Aroma is citrus, grapefruit, little flowers, fresh summer fruits. Complex but soft. Taste is fresh citrus pulp, fresh sourdough bread, no sugar. Mouthfeel allows acid to balance sweet breadiness. Very nice. Refreshing, light, aerated."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 10)",4.6,"750mL yellow wax thanks to JulienHuxley. Pours clear orange with higher, fine effervescence. Big lacing. 360 sheets of white lace. Nose is subtler: fresh potpourri, curaçao, vanilla, ice cream, fresh peach. Unreal- bright nectar fruits and fresh mango and elusive papaya and white chocolate mousse. Essentially perfect aroma. But not too different from Civil Disobedience #1. Taste is salty and quite lactic with high buoyancy like Fantome Saison and Sante 14. But fresh sweet rolls and subtle buttery biscuit is unmistakable Hill Farmstead. Very similar delicate malty balance found in Civil Disobedience #1. Palate is salty, restrained sour, key lime acid balanced by Hawaiian sweet rolls. Very beautiful. Refreshing and truly designed to be a summer quencher. Thankfully it will be brewed again.

Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 11)",4,"Bottle courtesy of JulienHuxley via GT2, merci bien mes amis!  Hazy golden yellow color, large white head, solid lacing. Aroma of perfume and subtle grandma’s armpits. Taste is vanilla, citrus, rose water, white wine.  Very nice."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 12)",4,"Thanks Seth for sharing this bottle. Pours yellowish with a golden haze. A little barrel with some floral elements in the nose. Smooth with a medium body, nice amount of carbonation. It finished dry with a little spice. This is a solid saison, but it was a disappointment from such a great brewery, when compared to so many of their other beers."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 13)",4.1,"Bottle... This beer rocks!… Murky pear-colored ale with a small, fluffy, white head. Terrific retention. The bouquet is fruity and moderately acidic, offering lemon, apricot, pale malts and barely a whisper of  Anna’s medley of lavender, clove and other spice-rack goodies. Medium-bodied with a sandy mouthfeel and tickling carbonation. The flavor is quite tart, but not sour, furnishing pale malts, underripe apricot, bready yeast, a hint of lemon and only a rumor of Anna’s assortment of spicy phenols. Finishes tangy and Sahara-dry. Thanks so much to landhoney for generously sharing this excellent bottle of beer with the south Florida crew!"
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 14)",4,"Bottle generously shared by Seth.  Cloudy yellow pour with a white head.  The nose is somewhat bland with barrel highlights.  Real smooth with good carbonation.  Light citrus and orange notes with floral/herbal and woody undercurrents.  To be honest, after all the hype, I was expecting a whole lot more....."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 15)",4.8,"Thanks to OteyJ for generously cracking this bottle.  
Pours golden, hazy and lively.  The head is fluffy, white, delicate.  Aroma is monstrous tropical fruit, mango and a touch of citrus.  Complex notes of cheese, barrel, and light vinous notes are evident as well.  Incredible light, creamy mouthfeel makes this easy to drink quicker than you planned.  The flavor steps into a new realm with a tart funk not found in the aroma and plentiful barrelled nectar.  Delicious, dry, drinkable, complex, and interesting - Could this be any better?"
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 16)",4.9,"Gigantic thanks to oteyj for this bottle!! Pours a hazy gold with a gorgeous frothy head. Absolutely ridiculous nose; stunning cheesecloth and tropical funk, guava and mango, pink grapefruit, and hints of barrel and vinous sweetness. Flavor adds much more wine character, tart strawberry, with that same otherworldly funk and fruit. Bone dry. Nearly flawless."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 17)",4.8,"Sharing this with a few of the guys today. What a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon.

Served in a Hill Farmstead wine glass.

The beer is a beautiful golden color with a soft, white head. Noticeable lacing throughout the glass.

The aroma brings honey, grass, lemons, subtle funk, white wine, oak. Really complex and profound. The beeswax cap smells fantastic as well.

The flavor is a tad sweet, with a beautiful honey presence. Extremely well balanced. With every sip, a new flavor seems to emerge. Lovely white wine / white grape character. Pleasant, subtle tart character in the finish. Without doubt the most complex and gracefully balanced example of the style I have yet encountered. Like sipping a world class champagne or white wine.

Overall, this is certainly a stellar beer. I’m very glad that I was able to make it to this release and acquire this.

Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 18)",4.8,"Huge, huge thanks to Huhzubendah for sharing this bottle.  Served in a Hill Farmstead wine glass.  First off, the beeswax on the bottle is an excellent touch.  Not only does it look nice, but it smells phenomenal, setting the tone for the beer.  

The beer itself pours a nice, bright yellow.  Fairly clear with a huge white head and great retention.  As the head falls, heavy sheets of lacing on the sides of the glass.  Collar throughout.  

The nose carries a wonderful mixture of white wine, honey, hay, lemon zest, very light barnyard, and a touch of acidity.  Masterfully blended so that each time I take another whiff, something else seems to come to the front.  The flavor is equally as integrated, and is aided by an absolutely incredible mouthfeel.  Some green grapes alongside lemon and hay.  Mild earthy funk behind a good dose of white wine.  Touch of oak.

Mouthfeel is crisp.  Very nice carbonation.  The mouthfeel is an enigma.  At the same time, there’s a touch of sweetness alongside a bit of white-wine tartness, mild funk, and touch of oak.  Each aspect is beautifully melded together.  Hard to describe.  The flavor lingers and is accentuated by mild acidity.  Saison and touch of pepper comes through at the very end.  

Overall, this tastes like the blood of a fallen beer god.  It’s just a gorgeous beer, and one of my top 5-10 of all time.  A wonderful experience, and something tells me, Shaun has better things yet to come."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 19)",4.6,"750ml beeswaxed bottle opened on August 4, 2012. Batch 1, bottle #59. 



Golden yellow-orange with just over a finger of creamy, white head. 



Ann smells pungently of citrus, tropical fruit, and floral honey. The wine barrel aging works perfectly, imparting juicy lemon; a delicate grassiness; and ripe green grape; and hinting at a tickling acidity.



Ann is “not tame, but civil”—a pinch earthier and more obviously saison-like than the nose, with lemon verbena; citrusy, almost limey tartness; and a sweet-grassiness. Ann remarkably balances a number of disparate elements—most obviously, the citrusy sweet elements (lemon/tropical fruit) with the citrusy tart elements.  



I’m thankful I have another bottle, which means that I can enjoy it without studying it.  One of my favorites from Shaun."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 20)",5,"Hazy gold pour with a nice white head.  Good lacing as well.  Wine, tartness, oak, spice  citrus and musty basement on the nose.  All aromas are woven perfectly together.  It smells so good that i was hesitant to drink.  Flavor follows the aroma.  Funk, acidity, lemon, citrus, oak, wine, a hint of malt sweetness.  Tastes as good as it smells.  Medium body, very creamy.  The mouthfeel is as impressive as the aroma and flavor.  I do not rate many beers, but this is perfect for a funky/sour saison.  I have been impressed with everything from Hillfarmstead that I’ve tried, but this beer is on a differnt level.  The only flaw is that not many people will get to drink this."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 21)",5,"Bottle, thanks Shaun.   Poured into the brewers stemware.  Natural hazy golden pour with a medium sized fine bubbled white head with lots of lace.   Super clean and tart nose, wine barrel comes through but harmonizes so naturally with the base beer that you’d think it was always meant to be there.  Light honey, lemon, oak.   Fantasticly integrated flavor as well and not as wine dominant as some of HFB other wine barrel aged beers. Slightly slick and acidic palate, could stand for a touch more crispness but I’m not sure if that’s really a legitimate critique.   But this is a damn fine beer.  Shit, I’m really having trouble finding a way to take points away from this beer and it’s everything I want in a saison plus more.  This sorta reminds me of Shaun’s Saison Lambic Pinot Noir that he brewed in Denmark for the Norreboro brewery with the o’s that have lines going through them possibly diagonally but this is better.  I can honestly say that I’d rather be home here in NC drinking this awesome beer than to be in LA right now drinking copious amounts of awesome shit with my homies.  Because this is that good and I have it all to myself.  Sometimes, you have to be selfish."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 22)",4.8,"Poured into some Hill Farmstead stemware. Beautiful golden honey body with a fingers worth of foamy white head. Nice lacing. Lots of earthy French oak notes in the aroma. Light mustiness with hay and floral honey. The taste continues to bring out some great oak notes from the barrel and mixes with a touch of honey and earthy grains. Light floral-citrus acidity throughout. Tastes amazing. Body is smooth with perfect carbonation. The mouthfeel has a nice creaminess to it. Overall, this beer is essentially perfect. I really can’t see how a farmhouse ale/saison could get better than this. One of the best beers I have ever had."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 23)",4.8,"Clear deep golden body under an airy tall white head. Floral lemon and sun-kissed hay on the nose. Deliciously harmonious flavors... pineapple, floral honey, white grape, slight barrel presence and hints of funk. Crisp but not overly-dry. Ridiculously easy-drinking.

Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 27)",4.7,"Absolute masterpiece shared with ernesto987.  First thing I noticed was the bees wax dipping and the great aroma that gave off, i know its a little detail but its part of what makes Hill Farmstead Special.  Pours a cloudy pale straw color with billowy mirangue head that retains and leaves behind great lacing.  The aroma is just out of this world.  Aroma is tart lactic acid, floral perfumes, citrus fruits, musty basement(in a good way), and a mixture of spices.  Initial mouthfeel is amazing and smooth/creamy and the flavors start hitting right away.  Medium sweetness and floral notes with light fruits give away to tart lactic acid and citrus elements.  The finish is dry and welcoming and leads you to want to take another sip.  This is the type of craft and attention to detail that you rarely find.  STUNNING."

Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 29)",4.3,"pours a clear golden color with a frothy head that builds quickly. smells of wine barrel at first then the saison esters, brett and bright lactic notes. taste is a light saison with balanced barrel notes and a light acidity. more acidity than an average JP, yet balanced for the flavors. overall bone dry."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 30)",4.5,"750 mL bottle shared on Friday night of the 2nd Anniversary party by Shaun. Generally, this is Anna aged in Sauvignon Blanc barrels. 

Frothy, retentive near white head settles on a hazed golden body, slowly fading to a finger thick head and thin sheets of lace. Nose if funky, fruity and mildly sour. Medium light body, effervescent carbonation, and soft full texture. The barrel aging adds a dimension missing from the base beer, adding a strong white grape and light lactic sour presences; overall sweet and fruity though out, but well balanced and a dry finish. Same as James, this was a favorite of the weekend for me; can’t wait for a release of this."
Hill Farmstead Ann,"(2, 31)",4.9,"Bottle courtesy of Shaun at the Hill Farmstead 2nd Anniversary vip party. A bright golden pour yields a great frothy white head with thick lacing. White grape juice, quenching lactic acid, and mead notes abound, with an ever present funk profile, giving way to earthen cheesy brett and tropical fruits. Light body with pillowy effervescence and a dry crisp finish. I absolutely loved this beer, and it was one of the highlights of the event for me. 




Re-rate from a release bottle. Shared with my dad on my birthday. Nice to revisit this beer when I am completely sober. I certainly wasn’t for my original rating, but surprisingly I captured it pretty well. Very vinous, funky, and lactic, with vibrant nectar and tropical fruits trailing off with mead like notes. Complex farmy brett. The palate is just perfect. Soft but full carbonation with a bone dry finish. Vibrant, bright and complex. This is without a doubt my favorite beer from Hill Farmstead."

Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 4)",4.2,"$35, only 11% bottle at a small but interesting bottle shop in Grapevine Texas.

Low-ball glass at the employee lodge under a desk lamp.

Pour is a very dark but very clear, syrupy, ruby Robitussin. Some of the cork dusted off into my drink.

Smell is very vinous & stemmy. Slightly medicinal, herby honey. Sharp currants & black cherry pits. There is more honey in the nose than  anticipated.

Taste is oily, lemon honey on the stove when you're sick. Middle kicks in the currant, black cherry, sour plum & Pinot Noir. Lots of skin, but so bittersweet in both directions. The bitterness is leafy, twiggy & constant. The honey body & sweetness propels all the fruit forward, not able to express itself fully. So tart in between. I did want more honey character. It's there in spots, but it's fighting a losing battle with all this fruit. A more robust variety next time.

The body is oily, rich, tannic, warming, thick & inviting.

Great fruit wine."

Der Safteindruck verstärkt sich noch, dabei bleibt vom Met nicht viel übrig. Intensiv, nie alkoholisch, trockener Hintergrund von Johannisbeeren. Unsüffig. 10/11/8/10/12/10"
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 41)",2.7,"Aroma of concentrated blackcurrant cordial. Sweet and sticky, like drinking saft (cordial). Taste just like blackcurrant juice concentrate with sugar. It's not very drinkable, or complex."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 42)",4.7,"Pour at meadery. Pours ruby red. Lovely currant jam notes on the nose and tongue. Has the perfect balance of sweetness, tartness, and dryness. It’s like drinking jam. Another one that slides down the throat."

Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 46)",4.2,"Sample at Schramm’s, Ferndale. Dark red/purple. No head. Strong and complex aroma with blackcurrant prominent. But along with the fruit you can almost smell the leaves, stems and earth. Very juicy taste, raspberry fruitiness. Really delicious."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 47)",4.6,"375ml bottle shared with Vanessa in room at Sutton Brouerie hotel. Aroma: wonderful aroma of freshed but riped black currant, some perceptible sweetness from the aroma, some light flowers and strong alcohol. Perfection!. App: dark purple with minimal off white head. Taste and palate: medium body, medium high sweetness but still well balanced with the acidity and the strong black currant flavor. Overall: This is beyond delicious. This is my second mead from Schramm and I must admit I'm in love. I preferred this one over the raspberry version. I just wish I had more than one bottle. Drinking this mead with my love was a pure moment of happiness. I hope to get my hands on another bottle one day. Amazing!"
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 48)",4.7,"Batch 4 thanks to Ben. Pours deep opaque burgundy. Aroma is huge blackberry concentrate. Taste is massive blackberry and blackcurrant, blueberry sweet, slight honey sweet, a hint of blackberry and blueberry tart and sweet. Syrupy mouthfeel."

Flavour is upfront a sweetness bomb, some honey, while the black currant dominates with a very jammy character. It feels very well put together and is deliciously sweet."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 51)",4.7,"Oxford tastings, corked bottle; 11% ABV
Dark ruby color. Very deep aroma of currants, vanilla cake, green leaves; later, it shows aroma of German waldhonig mead; this is wonderful. Full bodied, silky, luscious; pure currant syrup flavor, pungent tartness, strong tannins, hint of vanilla.
Not a mead at all, but a wonderful fruit wine."

Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 53)",3.8,"Purple. Ok, smells like black currant, Tastes like blackcurrant. Sweet, syrupy. So a blackcurrant dessert wine (literally, Elephant Island Black Currant Wine), or a kir. I really do not get any honey character. It's tasty, because the fruit character is bright and expressive, backed by a really rich, happy sweetness with what, a clover honey sweetness(?) and even a touch of tannins in the finish. Hesitate to legitimize this as a mead, though, because it's not, and it's going to have to lose points for that. LOL expensive, so much base honey, residual honey and massive fruit."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 54)",4.5,"375mL bottle, pours a deep dark burgundy. Aroma is incredibly decadent, with heaps of pithy black currant, followed by lightly sweet honey - oh man, the fruit is impeccably deep and penetrating. Flavour is very sweet, with a wonderful honey sweetness and immensely potent black currants. Sweet, but not cloying, penetrating the taste buds to a perfect degree. Elegant and impeccably crafted. Wonderful."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 55)",4.2,"Tasting @ Tim's. Pours dark red, thick and with high viscosity. Nose has beewax, lots of black currants, booze but also some vinous wine character and tannins. Taste surprises me with strong black currant character, tannines, fresh berries. Warming and has sweetness but not too much of it there. Beewax and light honey.

Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 70)",3.9,"Bottle from trade, sample shared @ Borefts Hotelroom with SinH4. Cheers Stefan! Insane deep dark red to purple color, no head.

Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 87)",4.7,"My only complaint is that I need a bigger bottle next time.
Fruity and smooth like all their wines. This one really softened and opened up with a little time in the glass. Taste was so smooth I never wanted to swallow."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 88)",4.2,"Bottle shared by Matt Waite. Pours deep maroon color with no evidence of effervescence. Nose is huge honey and blackberry, alcohol. Mouthfeel is very viscous, honey and blackberries explode in your mouth. I would have loved to pour this over pancakes!"

Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 90)",4.3,"Dark ruby pour. Hella lacing. Nose has Ribena to the second power, best honey you ever smelled. What a nose.. the taste is damn complex with oodles of berry goodness and honey sweetness. Very sweet with a fat texture. Taste explosion."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 91)",4.5,"Thanks Ryan. Batch 6 bottle. Dank blackcurrant on the nose, seriously weed-like. Kind of pine treeish too, like an evergreen or something. Lots of depth. Flavor is intensely tart, and super lush fruit. Heavily coats the mouth with how tart and sweet it is. Don’t get much honey character because the blackcurrant is jist so dominant. Lovely mead."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 92)",4,"Batch 4 bottle, shared by ygtbsm94 on 10/8/16, thanks Brad!
Dark, violet-chartreuse body shows good clarity and high viscosity.
Very tart, tannic and piquant in the nose, showing strong currant that probably outdoes the sweentess in the mead. Very authentic fruit character as always from these guys, with earth, spice and strong honey-vanilla backing it. Great strength of aroma and low alcohol while exceptionally clean.
Very, very tart and tannic in the mouth, the soft, sugar-laden texture certainly comforts the palate, but I’m less in love with the hard, nearly astringent acidity from the fruit here as opposed to most other, softer fruits. Of course, black currants are a very tart, astringent, acidic fruit and I like that it’s presented here, as is. Clean, low alcohol and wonderful, lush fruit flavors and sugars abound. Hard to imagine these guys making a bad mead.

Batch 10 bottle, drunk 9/20/17.
Bright piquant currant, with tons of spicebox, various vinous notes and light crayon-like waxines.  No booze, not sugary and quite nicely balanced by the acidity and tannin.  Quite mellow and syrupy through the front ending more mellow as a good balance is achieved."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 93)",4.9,"Black Agnes is one of the best alcoholic beverages you can put in your mouth. Little to no batch variation on these, so glad they are bottle more and more of this stuff."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 94)",4.4,"Bottle. Thanks Petter. Deeeeep purple liquid. Aroma of black currant, raspberries, blueberries, vanilla, honey, raw sugar and light licorice. Taste is very sweet with notes of black currant, raspberries, blueberries and raw sugar. Full bodied with slick mouthfeel. Awesome. So much flavor. Lots of black currant. Reminds me of my grandmother’s black currant saft. Yum."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 95)",4.8,"Without a doubt, the best use of black currant I have tasted in any alcoholic beverage. Fruit takes a stand over the honey but still incredibly balanced and not thin or thick, just right...nicely done Ken!"
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 96)",4.2,Sampled from the bottle. Pours a clear dark purple with a pink head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has a dry honey bite but is mainly dry and tart black currant/blackberry. Flavor has blackberry and black current that are both tart and sweet with a touch of honey.
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 97)",4.5,"Bottle share by Derek - thanks!! Happy 10,000! Dark black purple pour, massive jammy goodness, tart, sweet, honey goodness."

Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 99)",3.6,"I am not crazy for black currants but I imagine if you are, you will love this stuff--well, if you don’t mind sweet meads. It’s a deep rich red and very pretty. It has a kind of vegetable-ish aroma which I just kinda think is what black currant tastes like. Like I said, not crazy about it. It’s very sweet, sticky w/ a fair bit of tartness which brings out some nicer berry flavors. A bit of tannin seems to bring balance to the finish. This seems to have nice structure as mead just not my favorite fruit addition."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(1, 100)",4.5,"Non Beer Trip Beer Trip Rating #77. Sampled at the meadery, 3/12/16. Dark red, strong legs. Aroma of dark, rich currants, honey, raisin. The taste is tart currant and cherries, honey, vanilla, citrus. Medium bodied, rich, lingering tartness. Amazing."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 1)",4.7,"Bottle at north vs south tasting. Batch 04 bottle. Poured a intense deep dark purple colour. Nose is heavy black currants, berries, sweet honey, cranberries, lot’s of sweet red forrest fruits, caramel, light sweet vineous sweet desert wine.

Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 2)",4.8,"RBSG 2016 shared at the Grand Tasting after-party in the hotel lobby. Bottle, produced by turdferguson at around 4:00am, just the thing to keep the part going!! Deepest indigo, high viscosity. Sticky sweet intense black currant, blackberry aroma and flavour-- the very essence of what this fruit can be. Perfectly balanced acidity. On a completely different level compared to its peers. Wow."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 3)",4.1,"Refrigerated 375 ml bottle from FlandersNed. Dark opaque violet, medium body, and sweet cassis aroma. Taste is rich cassis and slightly herbal honey. Thanks FlandersNed!"
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 4)",4.7,"A huge thanks to Justin for this bomb! Bonne fête Alex! Liquide d’un rouge rubis, sans bulles, sirupeux et collant au verre comme il est peut-être interdit de le faire dans certains états américains. Ce nez, mais quel nez! Une explosion fruitée de sirop de cassis, d’arbre en fleurs, d’écorce d’arbre, de branche verte, de cassis encore. D’une complexité déroutante! Jamais au grand jamais je n’avais respiré de pareils parfums! Le manège se poursuit en bouche alors que le fruit enrobe ma langue de sa douceur pourpre en un profond baiser. Du cassis, des fleurs de cassis, des arbres de cassis, du pollen de cassis, de la confiture de cassis... Bien sirupeux, outrageusement généreux, la complexité de ce liquide va bien au-delà des mots."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 5)",4.1,"Bottle thanks to Mikem; shared with Linh, Paul, Brendan, Erica and Andrew. Pours a deep glowing purple body with viscidity and thick legs. Nose is dark red wine, alcohol and plastics. Mouthfeel is great - silky, rich and textured with perfectly nuanced acidity; notes of melted grape juice, rich sweet berry character, assertive fruit sugars and melted jam. Not a huge fan of the aroma, but a great berry-forward flavor profile."

Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 8)",3.4,"[ bottle ][ 1.5oz ][ @Tasting ][ $? ][ Schnapps snifter ][ 03.25.16 ]

murky plum grapefruit juice, thin cream ring. Sugary nose, boozy honey-berry dominance. Honey obliterates front palate, light booze and medicine mid tempered by sugar, heavy mid-finish. Plenty of fruit and sugar throughout, decent fruit character but sweetness definitely mutes."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 9)",4.2,"Bottle at Woodshop 10. Still deep purple pour. Big legs. Mild alcohol aroma, earthy beets, fresh berry blend. Taste brings an excellent interplay of sweet and sour. There is also a tannic, vinous qualiry with some wooliness and firm balance. Body is dense and rich. Moderate spicy alcohol. Really excellent. I’d say, wow, those black currants really shine through. But Americans are rarely exposed to this fruit, so I have no idea what a currant tastes like."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 10)",4.3,"(375ml bottle) deep blood red color, lacing for days. Nose of black currant, touch funky, honey, complex earthy notes. Taste is sweet, black currant, tart fruit, earthy, complex, medium thick body, nice mead."

Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 13)",4.8,"Sweet black currant jam in a bottle. The second I open it I smell insane intense berries. The taste is so good, it’s just pure sweet honey and the essence of ripe, juicy currants. Should have bought more!!!"
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 14)",4.1,"375ml bottle pours a bright purple with some ringing, pink head. Nose has cherries, a ton of honey too, super fresh. Flavor has honey, but a ton of cherry and a ton of current. Almost juicy in a way. Finishes slick. Wow, a real treat."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 15)",3.8,"From a bottle at the DC tasting on March 25, 2016. Poured a slightly ruby-purple color with a small pink head. Aroma was light black currants, sweet honey notes. Light sweet honey, very tasty."

Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 21)",4.5,"Thanks to Luke for sharing this with a small beer nerd group last night. Pours a deep purple with no head, still mead so duh. Aroma is currant jam and white wine. Taste is a rich, savory, super sweet without being over the top delicious mead. The finish was the best part as it tasted like rose water. I really can’t say enough good things about this mead. It is heavy and I couldn’t drink more than 3-4oz in a sitting but this is one of the best after dinner, desert drinks I’ve had."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 22)",4.5,"375 mL skinny bottle shared by ebone1988. Thanks broham! This baby is batch #04. The pour is amazing. Thick and heavy, dark purple with a little pink in the mix. There is no head, other than a couple small bubbles, bright purple in color, due to the pour. The aroma is very heavy. There is a lot of booze and a wine character to it. The currants are there in force, but the sweetness is a little overshadowed by the booze. The flavor is unbelievable. It starts a little hot, but the immediate aftertaste is magnificent. It starts a little tart, and slowly moves into a beautiful sweet currant. The sweetness is amazing. It's very jammy. The mouth feel is spot on. There is a good thickness with hardly any carbonation, and just a lingeringly coating, fruitiness. It's great. This is a spectacular mead. You would never guess that this was 14% by the flavor. The aroma gives it away, but this is the first mead I've really, really likes. Hot damn did Schramm's nail this.

Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 23)",4.7,"Bottle shared with koleminer20 for Super Bowl 50. Batch #04. Aroma is black currant, lots of skins, tannins, not real sweet from honey but still real damn nice for a mead. Appearance is violet red, no head but the bubbles created from the pour were a little more purple. Taste is honey, then a ton black currant, skins, tart and sweet, layered, very dessert-like, wonderful. Mouthfeel is thick, jam-like, with a wonderful aftertaste of black currant that remains even now. Overall, I don?t usually go for meads, but this is a must try."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 24)",4,"Shared bottle. Pours reddish purple. Aroma of fruit and honey. Taste is currants, honey, and some alcohol. Top notch Mead."

Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 26)",4.3,"375 ml skinny bottle shared by Tmoney99 and myself with the group. Pours a clear reddish purple color with no head. The aroma and flavor have sweet honey, big berry fruitiness, the black currants add big flavor to this mead, smooth, no sign of the abv, this is right up there with my favorite meads."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 27)",3.6,"Skinny bottle, shared by alexsdad06 and tmoney99. Mostly clear, but very dark red brown color. Aw man, awesome big black berry fruit here. Some honey, but the fruit-preserve flavor here is massive, it’s more flavorful than most jams. Bigger sweet, kind of sugary, but short of cloying. Some mild warmth. Bigger body, kind of slick texture. Tasty, super-flavorful mead. A lot of sweetness for me, though. A tiny amount is enough."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 28)",5,Thick creamy mouthfeel that lingers on the palate. Rich honey and black currant flavors. Really just hard to beat.

Dark ruby red with no head. Aroma is intense with lots of tart, sweet and juicy black currants, sweet honey, vinous, a touch of earthy leaf notes and hints of alcohol. Taste is sweet and tart, juicy and fruity. Finish is tart with lots of juicy black currants with some floral honey sweetness and hints of earthy leaves and warming alcohol. Medium to full bodied, oily, sticky texture with a light dry /tart finish. 

Great, reminds me of the homemade black currant cordial I drank when I was young."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 30)",4,"375 mL bottle. Deep red. Smells a little odd. A bit chemical. Deep berries and honey. Tastes much better. Sweet honey. Deep currant flavor. Delicious. Slick and sugary body. Not quite the heights of Heart of Darkness, but close."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 31)",4.3,"Bottle. Clear blood red pour with no head. Currant and honey nose. So sweet, so smooth. Delicious honey, caramels, and Berry notes. Delicious."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 32)",4.1,"4oz pour from bottle. Deep bloody red pour, not quite completely clear, light haze. Aroma is fruity, quite winey, tart fruity aromas, red currant, light jammy notes, funky fermented honey smell. Taste is better, rich fruity, sweet, boozy undertones, completely mouth coating palate, ice cider style, typical Schramm. Really tasty stuff."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 33)",5,"Hands down, without a doubt, my favorite mead I’ve ever had. This was my ""gateway"" mead and got me into not only loving all things mead, but exploring other styles of fruit based drinks, such as iced cider."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 34)",4.8,"Sweet, sweet black currants. Purplish opaque appearance with an thick, coating mouth feel. It just sticks in your mouth. I feel like this is the sweetest of their stuff but it isn’t cloying at all, just great juicy sweetness. Unreal."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 35)",4.8,Prior to my experiences with HOD and Statement reserve this was hands down my favorite mead. Still holds its own though. Taste is sweeter than the others mentioned but in a good way. For the price. Buy them all.
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 36)",5,"I love this mead so, so much. So sweet. So syrupy. So amazing. Lingers on the back of the tongue. Might be better than HOD, and on par with Statement Reserve. The perfect amount of tartness vs. chocolate vs. fruit."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 37)",4.9,"Heavy thick burgundy color. Unreal tart, seedy, jammy black currant, viscous in the best possible sense. Best bang for the buck out there."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 38)",3.9,"Bottle in a stem glass. Pours deep purple with no head. Aroma of berries, honey, wine, light alcohol, and some light floral notes
 Flavor the same. Average texture. A great introduction to mead."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 39)",4,"Bottle shared in line by GonzoIllini (New Glarus, WI). Thanks, bro. Pours a deep berry tinged purple hue. Merlot colors and glow show a bit of a darker middle. Loose bubbles on the pour taper out quickly. Firmer legs on the swirl but not too much. Aromas are rich dark fruit of plum, currant and blackberries as we press on. Gentle honey, some wafts of red grape and earth. Initial is medum bodied, slick as it glides over the palate, never brooding or overwhelming. Black currant, earth and dried fruit. Plum, dark fruit and touches of honeysuckle. Backend is a bit dry, subtle tart trail out. Lovely stuff."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 40)",4.8,"375ml bottle courtesy of and shared with Meadme. First, I must say how hard it is to rate these meads. How to even compare this complexity to traditional meads such as we find in Poland. How does one go from rating a traditional mead aged for 15 years to a fruit loaded Schramm’s that’s nowhere near the same? yet this one sits in the top 5? Still, great stuff.

Couleur pourpre profonde , rien ne perce comme lumière. Huileux au verre.
Arôme est purement et simplement de cassis, comme ci on y avait verser des kilos de cassis. Retrouve un fin mielleux, terreux du fruit. Palais est énorme, plein de cassis, ponctué par la douceur du miel et à ce point on ne peut pas vraiment dire que l’on reconnait le type de miel tant le cassis est dominant. Retrouve une note astringente avec de fin tannin, collant aux lèvres. Absolument fantastique même si j’ai été épris de brulures d’estomac juste après, dire comme c’est intense. Genre de verre que l’on peut déguster pendant des heures."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 41)",3.9,"Pours dark red/purple with no head. Aroma of berries, sweet honey and cherries. Taste follows with tartness from the fruit. Loads of flavor, so good!"
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 42)",4.4,375ml. Incredible ruby color. Incredible dark berry aroma and flavor. Doesn’t have the overly boozy sweet honey flavor that every other mead has. This is just intense fruit with the perfect sweetness. Flat oily body. Like nothing I’ve had before. Need to find more Schramm’s now.
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 43)",4.8,"Numerous bottles over the last 6 months. This stuff is so delicious I could easily down a pint of this every night before bed, but that may be a bit much. Rich currant and cherry flavors dominate the nose and flavor. Pours reddish purple with nice legs, no head obviously. Just a fantastic drink that I wish I could have at my disposal to drink anytime. If I hadn’t had B. Nektar/Schramm’s Heart of Darkness this would without a doubt be my go-to #1 mead."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 44)",4.5,"Bottle thanks to Brian. Pours a clear purple with no head. The aroma is strong black currant and wine. Thick mouth, jammy, blackberry, vinous, grape, very impressive."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 45)",4.1,"Bottle at Sweet & Sour, Sätila, 2014-08-30. Deep purple colored with no head. Blackcurrant, honey, tart aroma. Black currant, tart, blueberries, sweetish flavour with some honey notes. Lovely :-)"
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 46)",4.5,A: Black currant sure hits the nose hardcore! Very pleasant! Some honey as well. T: Sweet with an excellent black currant flavour! O: I love this! Just like picking the berries straight from the bush and just mash them with some honey.

Where: Shared in Adamjackson’s hotel room.

Appearance: Dark red colour, no head.

Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 48)",1.5,"Bottled, thanks hackobock!  Deep burgundy colour. Aroma of concentrated black currant lemonade. Very sweet with sticky mouthfeel and full body. Syrupy black currant juice concentrate. Alcohol fight with sugar in the finish. Superficial and sticky."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 49)",4.1,This is probably the best mead I have ever had and I don’t even like meads.
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 50)",4.5,"Bottle. No label taken. Pours purple. Nose/taste of black currant, port, honey, vanilla - medium body."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 51)",4.2,"Bottle. Ruby purple pour. Sweet honey, berry and black currant aromas. Sweet fruity, tart berries and honey sweet flavors."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 52)",5,"This is a perfect mead. For as amazing as Heart of Darkness is, this one is my Platonic Ideal. Wonderful aroma of jammy currants and rich honey gives way to a lush, full-bodied and viscous mead that coats your tongue with everything wonderful you could want. Batch 2 reduced the sweetness of Batch 1 by a couple percent, making it a bit easier to drink more of it without feeling like things got too cloying, but this is absolutely a sweet mead in the best of ways. All that sugar helps balance the tart currant bite and make each sip a wonderful little explosion on your tongue.

This is probably the best mead in the world, IMHO."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 53)",3.9,"From Ryan’s bottle at tasting, Seattle. Thanks so much! Brilliant deep red-purple. Raspberry, horseradish aroma. Coating, thick. Good raspberry-cranberry, tartness. Sweet, honey, a little sweet fruit wine. Lovely."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 54)",4.1,"Poured a dark blackberry color with light dark red legs, aromas of dark fruit, currants, blackberry jam, light musk and some light honey sweetness. Flavors were a mixture of the aromas and balanced as hell. Really enjoyed this one wish I had more because this is a world class mead not overly sweet just right."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 55)",3.9,"Willrunforbeer’s grand mead tasting. Batch 2. Merlot color. Aroma is rich, layered currant. Very nice. 


The flavor is just as rich in deep currant, almost had a jam character. Nice fuller body. Almost a blueberry/currant hybrid. Damn, really juicy."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 56)",4.7,"Bottle - Holy moly, this is great!!! Sweet black currant nose. The taste is sweet with more currants, lots of honey, and extremely smooth. I want to drink it all."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 57)",4.3,"bottle shared by tom10101, thnaks dude! pours clear and bright dark burgundy, without a head, spectacular legs. cherrywood and cherries, red grapes, must, fat cabernet sauvignon grpaes; peppery, spicy and very floral honey, milk chocolate notes too, wood. flat carbonation, medium to full body - viscous, sweet but not really cloying, lightly astringent, warm, very fruity and spicy-peppery honeyed finish. very impressive."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 58)",4.2,"Bottle 375ml.
Pours very dark purple with no head. Lots of sugar on sides of glass. Aroma is of berries, tannins, spices, flowers. Taste is of berries, sugar, honey, flowers, alcohol. Palate: Intensely full bodied. No carbonation. Overall: Nice complexity. Outstanding flower features."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 59)",4.1,"Bottle shared by Tom, thanks again! Pours a dark red and completely still with no head but some nice legs. Nose is of alcohol, cherries and light burnt honey. Taste is of currants jam and pretty sweet but it is saved by a light lactic acidity. Mouthfeel is coating and dense. A fine after supper drink!"
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 60)",4.4,"Bottle (375 ml). Huge thanks to Chris for this one! Deep burgundy with nice legs. Aroma is of deep fruits (black currants, black cherries), honey, almost vinous notes, tobacco notes and some sweetness... quite complex! Taste is sweet but not cloying with intense fruitiness (black currants, black cherries), honey, vinous notes and light tobacco. Medium body. Liquorous/vinous mouthfeel. Lingering fruity finish. A bit tannic too. Incredibly tasty beverage with a nice depth. It’s hard to showcase the fruits more than that. Even if it’s quite sweet and high abv, it’s easy too drink and way too easy to enjoy! Loved it!"
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 61)",4,"Bottle thanks to dfonorow. Poured deep dark red with no foam. Aroma pungent with apple vinegar, wine, honey, shrimp cocktail sauce. No carb med bod. Tastes full of blackcurrant honey sweet sauce. Good stuff"
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 62)",4.6,"Pours deep, deep purple that coats the glass. Aroma has currant and stone fruit....oy, the aroma. Between seeing it tear and the aroma, you know this will be good. Taste is everything one expects from a schramm fruit mead, and that is an onslaught of currant (in a good way) with exceptional balance. May be my favorite ""shelf"" mead from them."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 63)",4.6,A glass on tap from the meadery. It pours a very dark red color with a hint of lighted red. A dark fruit aroma. A perfect tart feel and taste upfront. A really nice dark fruit feel and flavor all throughout. Very drinkable. Honestly probably the best mead Iâ€™ve ever had. Very good stuff. The perfect balance of tart and fruit feel.
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 64)",4.7,"Purple. Nose is grapes, nothing spectacular. Taste though - jesus this is incredible. Grapes, honey...cannot put to words how good this is. Right up their with HoD."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 65)",4.5,"From bottle at Schramm’s. Pour is deep purple with red tint. Smells of black currants, port wine and sweet honey. Nicest finish I’ve ever had in a mead,. The sweetness completely masks the alcohol."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 66)",4.2,"Batch 1. Completely black grape juice reddish hues. no head obviously. Nose is so blackberry forward and full of blueberry and dried raisins. Whoa. Sweetness is up to 11 in this one. It fades quickly to a ton of berry notes. incredibly juicy and full of huge blackberry seedy fruit salad and a touch of honey 



Batch 2. Crimson red, really nice legs on this one, looks very sticky like welch’s grape juice. i get a lot of the same nose from last batch. raisins are here and blackberry and honey melon with very faint cherry. Yeah, the viscosity is way more intense. Viscous thick grape jelly, honey sweetness. Very sweet, just insanely intense! I honestly love this way more than the batch one that I had a few months ago.



Batch 10
Dark purple red. Nose is very raw. Like raw blueberry  and currant. Whoa. Juicy fruit, starburst, simple syrup, pineapple. Dry chalky finish. Delicious."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 67)",4.1,"Bottle - Plum, grape, blackberry green pepper and black pepper. Deep maroon. Plum, tobacco, leather and light berries. Green pepper and so much complexity that I could write for hours. Stunning."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 68)",4.3,"Batch 001. The pour is a dark ruby red. The aroma is sweet fruit syrup. The taste is sweet, but not overly tart or sweet. A perfect blend. One of the best meads I have had. 

---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 69)",4.1,"Bottle. Thanks Sean! I have a bias towards things that are Black Currant flavored and not nasty, because they help me connect with my childhood, so I’m a little partial here, but this is very nice. Aroma glows of candied black currant juice and a distant hint of honey florals. So many meads I’ve had lately reek of beeswax and not much else. This has none of that. Moderate sweetness is cut by black currant acidity and well integrated alcohols. Smooth, gentle and sipping. Very nice."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 70)",4,"Bottle courtesy of Kermis. Huge thanks. Poured a dark cabernet red with little life. The aroma is sweet malt, cherry fruit, yeasty sweaty socks but in a nice kind of way. The flavour is moderate to strong sweet with a rich sweet sticky cherry fruit palate. Full bodied with zero carbonation. Very different to anything else i’ve tasted before. Will appear to many wine lovers I feel. An ideal desert wine. Would love to own a few bottles of this!"
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 71)",4.4,"Rating #5000 and it’s not a beer! Pours dark dark red with no head, red wine but darker. Aroma of raisins, cherries, sweet red fruits, overripe fruits, light herbal, spice. Flavor is light heavy sweet. Warming in the finish, both am alcohol and spicy warmth. Full bodied with soft carbonation."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 72)",3.6,"bottle courtesy of and shared with Kermis 5000th beer

Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 73)",4.1,"375 ml bottle shared by Chris - thanks again, Chris! Pours a deep, clear black cherry color with no head. Aroma of black currants, plum, honey, and black cherry. The flavor has intense black currants - rich, sweet, and somewhat tart - that goes all the way to the back of the palate and is offset by just a bit of honey. Medium-bodied, with low carbonation and a fruity, coating mouthfeel. Another excellent mead from here."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 74)",4.1,"Bottle 375 ml at Sweet & Sour, Sätila, 2014-08-30. Thanks to tkrjukoff!

Rich Ribena berry red with moderate off white edgeing.

Full bodied, viscous feel, sweet tones and warming alcohol in the close.
Good mead action."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 79)",4.2,"From bottle at Schramm’s. Pour is deep purple with bubbles that fade quickly. Aroma and flavor of overly sweet honey, black currant juice, raisins, and port wine. Sweetest finish I’ve ever had in a mead, completely masks the alcohol."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 80)",4.4,"Bottle shared in London - huge thanks to Jack. Pours deep purple, engaging. The nose has heavy honey with berry accents, some toasted honey, black currant. Massively sweet flavor with thick honey, tart blueberry, further currants, sticky toasted sugars. Full bodied, oily and chewy. Sticky sweet finish with lots of jammy fruits, nice tart berries. Extremely decadent. I love it."

Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 82)",4,"Bottle big thanks to Jack to the L. It pours deep, deep purple... The nose is sweet, woody, rich, jammy, blackcurrant, honey, vanilla and earth. The taste is slick, fruity, tangy fruits, blackcurrant, honey, jam, mild acidity, wood, warming alcohol, oily and even more jam with a dry, fruity finish. Full body, fine carbonation and oily mouth-feel. Rich and fruity. Very nice. Delicious."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 83)",4.5,Notes. pours very dark almost purple in color. aroma is dark fruit and some honey and booze. taste is sweet dark cherry up front with just a slight sweet and tangy finsh.
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 84)",4.5,"Pour at the meadery, dark reddish brown pour with no head, aroma is big spice, cinnamon, dark fruit, lots of currant, hints of oak, nice dark reddish fruits, honey in there. Taste is a mix of dark fruit, earth, nice cinnamon, spice, yeast, nice honey and vanilla finishing very sweet. Wow, this is world class, so much black currant."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 85)",4,"very pretty, deep, near black purple, bright reddish showing through the thinner areas. very thick legs left behind; I feel like if I kept swirling eventually the entire drink would be stuck to the side; ha!
prominent grapey berry everywhere. rich, some alcohol but nothing solvent, very inviting. Floral honey is everpresent though well behind the strength of the fruit.
The flavor is nearly the equal of the nose in depth and richness. Incredibly sweet, but a decent amount of alcohol and of course ample berry tannin help out a bit. remains balanced towards sweetness no matter what I serve it at. chilling helped drinkability a bit, and soothed some of the more hotter alcohol notes, but muted the incredibly rich nose. Took me about 30 minutes to drink a few ounces before going back for a couple more. I’ll have to revisit this one in the cold of winter."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 86)",5,"I don’t see how anyone can drink this magical drink and NOT give it a 5.0 rating. AWESOME boysenberry syrup and Welch’s grape juice smell. Incredible deep purple pour. Taste is insanely delicious fruit berry syrup. Thick and incredibly rich with sweet flavor. If you like your berry meads tart, go for Heart Of Darkness, but if you like them sweet like I do, then Black Agnes is definitely the one for you!"
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 87)",4.4,"Big thanks to dak for sharing this and a gentleman’s nod to MeadMe for . . . well, being awesome and being MeadMe. Cheers Greg! The tall thin glass bottle pours with a deep purple body that has red to rosy red hues and exhibits thick glass staining legginess. The aroma is thick and stiff with sugars and then big ’ole juicy berry goodness followed by thin berry skin like tartness near the end of the draw. The taste unleashes smooth rich juicy dark grape concentrate with a depth that runs deep underground. At the edges of the berry nectar goodness are thin berry skin like tart tannin notes that give this hints of balance amid the taste of rich sweetness. At times it feels nectar sweet and earthy fruit that has a plushness to it. Lovely."
Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 88)",4.8,"Thanks meadme!! Deep purple pour. The flavor. Shiiiit. Wow. Sweet tart, light grapey notes, currants, raisins, ports, sweet but tart. Fuck this is incredible. Balanced and amazing."

Schramm's Black Agnes,"(2, 97)",4.7,"Bottle @ Schramm’s: Nearly black center with a deep crimson & purple-tinted outline at the edges. Aroma is simply amazing, such a huge black current, prune, & raisin-like presence. Tangy, sweet, & even a little tart. Super savory with just a hint of underlying honey. Taste is loaded with mildly tart currants & dark fruit jam... Raisins, figs, dates. Nice & tangy up front with a hefty sweetness that cuts through perfectly mid-palate, lingering into a jammy sweet, currant & honey finish. I’m not the biggest fan of currants but this mead blew me away. Not only the best mead I’ve ever tasted, but one of the greatest liquids to enter my facehole, ever."

Pleasant but not pronounced aroma, with rounded, lingering and balanced mouthfeel. To be honest, the beer failed to match my expectation. Still one of best among the style, but just don't try to fight KBBS.
香气很舒服但算不上浓郁，口感则圆润、悠长而平衡。说实话，它没达到我的预期。它仍然是这个风格里最好的酒之一，但别想着挑战KBBS。

Some pale off-white bubbles here and there but otherwise close to no head, black robe with hazy copper-hued edges. Intense and deliciously fragrant bouquet of chocolate liqueur, old madera, wet oak including the vanilla aspect, coffee cream, hazelnut oil, whisky, beef stock, caramel, touch of soy sauce. Sweetish, concentrated onset with umami mixed in, as sugared gravy with raisins, softly carbonated, very full, vinous, oily mouthfeel. Deep and thick nutty and toffeeish malt body with softly roasted bitter tail drenched in wet oak tannins and long-stretching, heating bourbon-coloured booziness; ends very rich bittersweet and complex.

Side Project Beer : Barrel : Time - 2017,"(1, 37)",4.5,"From notes. Enjoyed at the Side Project Cellar, with Gus, on November 24. 750 mL bottle, black wax. The pour is a nice dark black motor oil with a dark film of espresso colored ring of head with no lace as it lingers. The aroma is great. There is a dark chocolate and heavy roasted malt with a beautiful leathery undertone. A lightly bitter earthy hop comes in late and the vanilla comes through with a strong oak on the finish. This is complex and deep, but the hop is a little too detectable. The flavor is much of the same. The bit bitterness up front works with the light alcohol before the roasted malt, leather, tobacco, and a hint of oak lead away from the hop and finish with an almost dark fruit heaviness. The light vanilla and oak again bring up the back and this warms all the way down. The mouth feel is lighter heavy bodied with a soft carbonation and a nice charred oak and bitter chocolate roasted malt on the finish. This is a solid beer, but is definitely overshadowed by Derivation. 9 5 9 4 18"
Side Project Beer : Barrel : Time - 2017,"(1, 38)",4.4,"750 ml bottle at the Side Project Cellar, shared by Doug. Thanks again, Doug! Pours a deep, dark, nearly opaque brown with a small dark tan/brown head that settles into a ring. This is somewhat jarring next to Derivation #8 because, as the description details well, there are no adjuncts in here and D8 is popping with vanilla and coffee and coconut. There is also a lot more balance between barrel and base than the first iteration of BBT on draft, which was called Barrel-Aged Time when it debuted for the Coffee Crawl in 2017. That one, with the old Heaven Hill barrel, was intense in the way it soaked up the barrel, and was bourbon-forward and almost dry. This one certainly has plenty of oak and vanilla and slight char and toasted sugar, balanced by roasted malts and dark chocolate. Medium-plus bodied, with modest carbonation and a smooth, roasty, rich mouthfeel. Excellent. It's being overshadowed by D8, but that's expected. Great in its own right."

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(1, 1)",4.1,"Not my usual genre. Dark strong without an excess alcohol taste. Best drunk slightly chilled for those European winter dried fruits (think Xmas cake or pudding) to come through, too cold and this + spices get demolished. Nice for a change."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(1, 2)",5,"Optisch sehr dunkel mahagonifarben. Die hellbraune, feinporige Schaumkrone wirkt flaumig und ""nur"" mäßig gut haltbar, was aber bei einem so hohem Alkoholgehalt nicht wenig verwunderlich ist. Die Duftaromatik verwöhnt mit unglaublich kräftigen Noten von würzigem Waldhonig, dunklem Karamell, leichten Anklängen von Schokolade, Powidl, Dörrobstnoten von Kirsche, Beeren, Pflaume und Feige, ebenso ein Hauch von Sherry und/oder Portwein. Unglaublich komplex! Der Antrunk kommt weichrezent, süß und breit malzig bis reiffruchtig mit leichten Anklängen von Dörrobst und Rumtopf. Im Mund breitet sich ein wuchtiger, wärmender Körper mit sanfter und leicht moussierender Rezenz, schwerer, öliger Textur, leichter Trockenheit und präsenter Süße aus. Auf Zunge und Gaumen zeigen sich komplexe Noten von dunklem Karamell, leichter Schokolade, fruchtigem Dörrobst (Kirsche, Beeren, Pflaume, Feige), leicht rumige Anklänge, die an Rumtopf erinnern und bis in sherry- und portweinartige Noten übergehen. Ich glaube, man kann herauslesen, dass man es mit einer sehr hohen Komplexität zu tun hat, die in ein unfassbares und harmonisches Gesamtbild mündet. Drinkability ist bei 11,3 % (!!!) kein Thema - dennoch wirkt dieses Quadrupel nicht zu schwer oder erschlagend. Im Nachtrunk wirken sämtliche Aromen mit einer leichten Süße, einer schönen Wärme und einer leicht alkoholischen Note sehr gut und lange nach. Erst nach längerer Zeit vernimmt man eine sehr zarte, trockene Herbe, die nach wie vor mit einer angenehmen Schokonote hinterlegt ist.
Fazit: Dieses Bier zählt definitiv zu den allerbesten der Welt!"

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(1, 21)",4.5,"""Quadrupel"" - ""das stärkste Rochefort"" - ""11,3% vol."" waren alles Stichworte, die mich bewogen haben heute nur ein Bier zu verkosten. Zucker und Weizenstörke fallen auch hier auf. Auf Gewürze wurde verzichtet. Trappistes Rochefort 10 riecht nach Alkohol, Karamell  und Röstaromen. Die beige Schaumkrone ist daumendick, gemischtporig und bleibt dann auf niedrigem Niveau stabil. Die Farbe ist fast schwarz. Beim Antrunk kommen eine komplexe, kaum erfassbare Gschmacksvielfalt auf den Verkoster zu. Trotzdem versuche ich eine grobe Auswahl zu nennen: Sherry, Rosinen, Kaffee, Honig, Wein aus Beerenauslese. Beim Abgang setzt sich Hefe durch und Hopfenbitterkeit stellt sich leicht ein. Der Alkoholgeschmack ist aber so heftig, dass ich mir beim Verkosten viel Zeit lasse. Somit sprechen wir von einer sehr niedrigen Rezenz. Dieses Quadrupel geht an die Grenzen des guten Geschmacks. Für die Fans von Starkbier sicher ein Highlight!

*Nota: en esta ocasión la note muy aromática, casi como un perfume, nunca habia olfateado una cerveza así, ni las mismas Rochefort 10, pero es casi como si estuviera bebiendo una cerveza perfumada de forma muy seductora."

Pas vraiment trop d amertume"
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(1, 48)",4.6,"33cL bottle at Carlsens Kvarter
Cloudy dark brown with a nice, but diminishing beige head. Deep, complex, and very vinous aroma that brings your thoughts to a nice Barolo wine. Intoxicating notes of sherry and burned figs. Extremely well-balanced and intense taste, deep, sweet, and complex, very vinous with notes of prunes and cocoa. The alcohol is present, but very well hidden in its intensity. Texture is very foamy, more oily than watery. Exquisite beer, and my old favourite.

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(1, 49)",4.5,"Dark ripe fruits. Sweet caramel. Butterscotch. Prunes. Light toasty malts. Yeasty. Lively carbonation. Alcohol taste well masked, just some warmth down the throat. Complex flavours. Solid belgian ale."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(1, 50)",4.7,"Rochefort 10 pours a dark brown color with a red hue. Its beige head is and frothy and sustains itself well for the brew’s weight of 11.3% alcohol by volume. The dense nose is an incrediby complex interplay of notes including brown cane sugar, caramel, baked apple, pear, figs, blackcurrant, milk chocolate, biscuit, butterscotch, as well as bright bubblegum notes and even some fruity ginjoko. This incredible bouquet is not simply dark as one would expect, but its darkness is accentuated by bright aromas at the same time. On the palate, the muted sweetness is balanced out by the heavy flavors up front, which include notes of prunes, caramel, and dark bread crust, before the roastiness of the malts as well as the bitterness from the hops invigorate the mid-palate. Peppery spiciness and warming alcohol conclude each mouthful with a dry finish, which leaves impressions of dark fruits and dark bread behind. A deeply complex brew."

It's a hazy dark amber with TONS of effervescent sparkle, 1/2-finger width crackling tan head with excellent retention and trace lacing.

Very nice aroma, intense and rich with hints of alcohol, caramel, something herbal, and fruits. Great. The most perfect and complex taste among the Rochefort for me, not extremely different from the 6 and 8, but very rich and perfectly done. Taste is elegant, full and sweet with hints of roasted malt, caramel, chocolate, yeast, prunes and dried fruit, somewhat winey. Good sparkling carbonation and very strong at 11.3% abv yet well hidden. More sweet than bitter but spicy and warm... absolutely incredible taste."

It was in many ways a classic quadrupel - interesting winey aroma and flavours; quite light on the palate for the percentage and girth. Didn't wow me but was lovely anyway. (13/3/21)

Bottle from the brewery, Rochefort. As above, it has a profound aroma that is hard to pinpoint. It's a mature and profound trappist ale. 3.8 to 3.7."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(1, 75)",4.1,"330 ml bottle. Pours dark brown with beige creamy head. Aroma is lots of dark fruit. Full-bodied and increasingly rich flavour, but also immensely moreish. Perfectly balanced sweetness with light bitterness and even a little roasted malt too. The beer is perfectly balanced and the alcohol tickles the taste."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(1, 76)",4,"Högt ställda förväntningar infrias redan innan ölet är i munnen. Aromen är tung av frukt, sirap och tobak. Luktar nästan som om det vore en buljong. Och ja...smaken är en mastodont av sötma, torkade frukter och lakrits."

W aromacie suszone owoce, słodkie dojrzałe czerwone owoce, melasa, przypieczone ciasto. W ustach klasyczne dla belgijskich piw musowanie wynikające z wysokiego nagazowania. Piwo jest treściwe, w smaku całe mnóstwo suszonych słodkich owoców. Na planie drugim nieco pikantnych nut drożdży, mocno zaznaczonych również na długim finiszu.

Very strong and clear taste of alcohol in beginning, but then full aromatic fresh with clear notes of dry fruit like raisin and a little plumb. One of the finest beers I have ever had. Reminds me of the Danish gambrinos dark only with a royal Belgian twist."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(1, 79)",3,"Un po’ troppo dolce per i miei gusti e marcatamente alcolica, si sente molto il malto caramellato, dopo un po’ stanca"
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(1, 80)",4.3,"The pour demonstrates murky brown liquid, yeast following from the end of the bottle and a fluffy, but relatively light, head. I love the aromas. It's a combination of malts, caramels / molasses, plum / raisin and Christmas spices. The first sip brings out the breadiness of the beer and exposes the full-body seen in most trappist ales. At mid-palate the flavors open up with a large hit of malt and molasses. As it continues to roll through your mouth, you'll start to experience the fruits and spices which will leave you with a pleasant aftertaste and wanting to jump in for another sip. It's a beer to take your time with, both to admire the complexity and its potentt 11% ABV. For me...a fine symphony in a glass."

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(1, 93)",4.7,"I knew about this beer and the hype around it, which is why i approached it thinking ""I really want to try it, but it will probably be just slightly above average.

I was pleasantly wrong. I have never tasted a beer so strong, being so balanced, almost light? Nice body, smooth, a nice kick at the start, flavour packed, that finishes gently almost disappearing, with the ever so slight sweet linger that makes you go for the next sip.

Classic, but at the same time unique, almost as if this was truly the highest form, the perfected form of the classic in style. 


I didn't get the appeal until i tasted it, for some reason this beer makes me feel better psychologically than palate- wise, this beer is my comfort zone."

W aromacie nuty kwaśnych wiśni, marmolady, czerwonego jabłka, czerwonego wina, alkoholowa, ciemnego ciasta, biszkoptów, lekkie przyprawowe. W smaku słodkie, deserowe, daktyle, rodzynki, toffi, ciemne ciasto, nugat, biszkopty, deserowe wino, wiśnia w likierze, szlachetny alkohol. Finisz niestety pusty, jakby urywający się gwałtownie. Pełnia średnio wysoka, wysycenie średnie do średnio wysokiego, goryczka niska, alkohol wyczuwalny, ale nie nieprzyjemny. Kolejny klasyk porządnie wyleżakowany i odhaczony, trochę słabszy od Bernardusa, ale też bardzo dobry.

Aroma of sour cherries, marmalade, red apple, red wine, alcoholic, dark cake, biscuits, slight spices too. Sweet taste, dates, raisins, toffee, dark cake, nougat, biscuits, dessert wine, liqueur cherry, alcohol. Empty, suddenly ending finish, unfortunantely. Medium to high body, medium to medium high carbonation, low bitterness, warming, yet not unpleasant, alcohol. Another cellared belgian classic quad, very good, but i prefer Bernardus."

Smells amazing: bourbon and spices; and tastes even better: burned fig, walnut, caramelized sugar, spices, cardamon(?). Personally too high in alc. vol. to my taste. Not as rich as no 8 (favorite of the three). Alcohol vol. is not too intensive/over-present in the drink, it is not offputting (I find 6 to be that).

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 27)",3.7,Colore marrone scuro con riflessi mogano. Al naso e alla bocca intensi sentori di sciroppo e caramello. Sapori speziati leggermente acri e piccanti con note fruttate di prugna e cacao. Corpo forte ma raffinato. Un super classico delle birre trappiste!!!!
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 28)",3.8,"Dark brown with white head. Smell of prunes, malt and brown sugar. Taste of sweet barley malt and a great lasting aftertaste of prunes (almost like an old port). Nice"
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 29)",4.2,"Aroma of rye, barley and mild plum
Beatiful brown colour with lasting head
Taste of sweet barley malt and mild alcohol
Extremely smooth mouthfeel. 
Extremely nice beer"
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 30)",5,"For me the best strong dark beer, best Trappist and simply my no. 1 beer. Full of taste, pleasantly sweet, not like the Gulden Draak which is good but so sweet that I can only enjoy it on special occasions. I almost never drink beer with less than 7% alcohol because they are too weak and tasteless, but this beer never disappoints, always satisfies after one or two bottles. The full taste combines great with a simple meal or BBQ."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 31)",4.3,"Yeah it has finesse and delicacy, but it also has serious weight, like a sumo wrestler doing ballet"
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 32)",4.3,"0.33 bottle.
Hazy, indeterminate but not ugly color, large foam when filled and then half a finger. The aroma is a nice blend of caramel, raisins, cognac and Belgian beer. Full-bodied, very sweet beer. I won’t go into detail, any dried fruit can be felt from the taste. When heated a little, the foam is bigger and nicer. At first it is very carbonated, if left to stand, it is finer. Great dessert beer, but I've already drank a level or better with it. Mainly excessive sugaring which made him not get more points.

 Zavaros,meghatározhatatlan, de nem csúnya szín, kitöltéskor nagy, majd fél ujjnyit megmaradó hab. Illata karamell, mazsola, konyak, és belga sör szép elegye.  Testes, nagyon édes sör. Nem részletezem, bármely aszalt gyümölcs kiérezhető az ízéből. Picit melegedve kitöltéskor a hab nagyobb, szebb. Elsőre nagyon szénsavas, ha állni hagyjuk, finomabb. Remek desszert sör, de ittam már ezzel egy szintűt, illetve, jobbat is. Főként a túlzott cukrosság ami miatt nem kapott több pontot."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 33)",4.2,"Butelka. Ciemny ,mahoniowy kolor. Piana również bardzo ładna,w kolorze kości słoniowej,wysoka,zdecydowanie zdobi szkło. Dominują palone cukry,susz owocowy,karmel,lekkie drożdże w tle. Piwo jest świetnie wyważone ,alkohol delikatnie łechce podniebienie. Można by pisać ale lepiej rozkoszować się czym dobrym w słoneczny ,przedświąteczny dzień."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 34)",5,"Um. C'mon. This beer is perfect. I dont say so very often. There us just nothing bad I can about it. It looks gorgeous, pouring deep reddish bronze. Nice even.bubbled tan head. Some lacing. Amazing complex aroma with caramel leading, raisin and plum following, and anise, smoke, and leather playing bit parts.  Its hefty, but not hot, nor cloying. Amazing malty raisin bread and rum fade. This makes my nuttsack very smiley."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 35)",4,Clear dark amber pour. Small tan head. Aroma is lots of dark fruit. Some candied sugar in taste and aroma. So smooth. Heavy and it’s effects are obvious. Yet smooth and excellent sugar grains. Mild gum. Just awesome all the way around.
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 36)",3.4,"Jak siostra 8 również posiada potężną, gęstą pianę, która dość szybko się dziurawi i lekko oblepia szkło. Również koloru brunatnego, ale wydaje się ciemniejsze. W zapachu trochę alko, rodzynki, kwiatowość, nuty utlenienia, winne. W odróżnieniu od 8 zdecydowanie posiada ciało, nie jest wodniste, słodkie, karmelowe, czuć alko, ale szlachetne, niemęczące. Rozgrzewa w przełyk."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 37)",5,"Bottle served. Very dark brown pour with medium beige head. Aroma is strong with dark fruits, roasted nuts and little to no hop, despite being 11.3 ABV. Just the perfect mixture and balance among each ingredient. Cannot beat this, Westvleteren XII will give way to this Rochefort 10 on the top of my list."

Nie wiem o co chodzi, ale kompletnie nie pachnie i nie smakuje jak quadrupel. Wyraźna nuta czereśni/wiśni w aromacie i smaku, w zasadzie mało fenolowe, trochę czerwonych owoców, ogólnie raczej winne doznania. Ogólnie smaczne, ale nie tego się spodziewałem."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 39)",4.2,"Bottle into Rochefort goblet. Dark with decent foam. Aroma of plum, raisins, bubblegum and alcohol. Similar taste. Slightly sweet with notes of brown sugar. Well balanced. Flavor opens up as the beers warms up to reveal more plum, anise and dark fruits. Nice Belgian brew."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 40)",4.2,"33 cl, drunk at Bibere house of beer, Piraeus. Pours brown/dark amber colour with a huge, long lasting head. Strong malty aroma and taste. Its best characteristic is the unimaginable bittersweet mouthfeel - it's worth drinking just because of this."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 41)",3.6,"Bottle from Drink? Hebden Bridge.  Very dark with a lovely crisp smoothness that hides its strength very well.  The alcohol isn't very stated here even though it should be, just a subtle liquorice sweetness to compliment the fine textured mouthfeel."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 42)",4.8,My favourite beer. Best after som years in the cellar. The aftertaste goes on forever.
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 43)",2.9,"Dark brown-ruby color with big off white head, sparkling carbonation, floaties. Alcohol, caramel, dried fruit aroma. Dried fruity, caramel, boozy, old flavor. Warm, bit spicy palate, medium to heavy body."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 44)",4.1,"AROMA: Aroma a alcohol dulce alto. Ésteres a ciruela negra pasa altos. Aroma a lúpulo ausente. Fenoles bajos con notas a pimienta y notas bajas de vainilla. APARIENCIA: Cerveza de color caoba oscuro sin transparencia. Espuma de color pajizo, cremosa y sin mucha retención. SABOR: Ésteres altos con sabores que recuerdan las ciruelas negras pasas y pasas de uva. Amargor medio. Balance esteroso, frutal a frutas pasas y final en el que el alcohol se mezcla con las notas altas a frutas pasas de manera muy agradable. SENSACIONES EN BOCA: Cuerpo medio alto, carbonatación media-alta. Calentamiento debido al alcohol alto. No cremosa ni astringente ni áspera. IMPRESIÓN GENERAL: Gran cerveza en la que se impone el sabor a frutas pasas con notas de alcohol seco. Baja bebebilidad debido a su alto nivel de alcohol aunque muy agradable para tomar tranquilamente cuando el día ha acabado."

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 46)",4.2,"Copenhagen 20/8 2017. 33 cl bottle from Meny, Østerfælled Torv, Kbh Ø. Simple label stating that this is a Trappist Rochefort 10. Nice simplicity. 

Pours hazy dark dark brown with small off-white head. Settles as thin layer of foam barely covering the surface of the beer. Moderate lacing. 

Aroma is intense and contains both a strong sweetness but also a more sourish quality. Figs, brown sugar, plum and overripe berries meet wet cellar. 

Quite strong carbonation and thick oily texture. 

Flavor is heavy sweet without becoming cloying. Followed by medium bitterness. Aftertaste is quite sweet followed by quite strong bitterness. 

Very nice and well balanced Quadrupel. Truly a sipper which feels like a nice meal."

Rich, very complex, heavy, present. Some liquorice and plenty of red and dark fruits. Bready, creamy, some hints of coffee, dark chocolate, caramel,  vanilla. Freshness. Subtile sweetness developing into subtile bitterness. Robust yet smooth and creamy. A very pleasant, warm and lasting aftertaste. Absolutely fantastic!"

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 51)",4.4,"October 23rd, 2015 - Enjoyed with a good friend in a cozy setting, the Trappistes Rochefort 10 was so involved, so engaged, so magnetic, that I appear to have not recorded any notes at all, except that this particular bottle was best by September 10th, 2015. But I know this beer well, and the mellow sweet notes and unassuming complexity are familiar. It is still very much a nearly perfect beer."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 52)",5,"What can I say? 

We first entered The Subterranean Drinking Den without knowing truly what we were in for. 

My friend was shy at first, but with my support ordered the Rochefort 10 biere aka the brain-leg dis-connector. 

When the bottle was opened, the sweet aroma of the monastery filled the bar, everyone in the close vicinity looked around and asked, ""what is that?"" - me and my friend were shocked to say the least. Hints of Madagascan Vanilla pods mixed with Ecuadorian Cocoa beans hit the the two external openings to the nasal cavity in the nose. Simply put, a sense of enlightenment brought from the monks' biblical teachings spilled out in the room from the bouteille.

Now that the bottle opening is settled, we can move onto the pour. Exquisitely dark, the pour was like a river flowing through the desert solely on a mission to quench ones first. A large gasp overcame the room to which my shy no longer companion exalted ""be gone heathens of non Trappist connoisseurs, ye shall not comprehend the beauty of what thee witness - be seen and thus be shown!"". A sense of profundity overcame thee newly labelled heathens. 

It would be sacrilege to describe the taste of ones Trappist Rochefort 10, this is a journey one must overcome themselves."

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 61)",4.7,"330ml bottle in 2012. One of my all time favs. Deep brown with a dense beige head. Aroma of raisins, fruity esters, dates, light roast coffee, berries, coriander, cloves, soft fruit, grain and yeast. Full-bodied and increasingly rich and complex flavour, but also immensely moreish. Perfectly balanced sweetness with light bitterness and even a little roasted malt too."

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 67)",3.5,Delightfully thick body that is yeasty and somewhat sweet. No real tartness or bitter flavors.  Strong flavor but alcohol is not a dominating taste.

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 74)",4.2,"0,33 l bottle. Pours dark amber brown with a finger of lasting beige head. Aroma is fruity, plenty of dried fruit, dried plums in particular, raisin and dates, there is also some caramel and toffee. It has vinous properties, similar to strong red vine from a region with plenty of sunshine. Alcohol is present, but not too forward. Taste is quite heavy sweet and medium bitter. Body is full, carbonation mild, mouthfeel sticky. Finish is long, rich with dried fruit and mild lasting bitterness. Mild stomach warming sensation adds to very pleasant experience."

Overall: A masterpiece brewed by the Belgian monks :)"
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 79)",4.4,"11.2 oz. bottle. Easy availability at local bottle shop... about $6 a pop and well worth it. Cloudy, cola-brown appearance with enough carbonation to match. Big tan head nearly spilled over the sides of my glass, forcing me to rush to lick the sticky candied concotion. Sweet dark fruit aroma. Raisin, fig, spiced rum cake, plum notes come to mind. Winter seasonal spices are intermingled with care. Hints of cinnamon, anise, vanilla bean all work in harmony. Hearty dose of brown sugar and molasses hits you up front.  Sugar in the Raw. Grandma's scratch-made pastries. Sweet, but not cloying. Warming, only mildly creamy. Cola-like tanginess in the finish. Clocking in at 11.3% ABV, this beer conceals the alcohol content unbelievably well, a testament to the smooth balance of the recipe. A very sweet beer. It's almost like taking a bite out of a decadent cake. Ideal for dessert after a nice meal, but also stands up all on its own. Dense fruity sweetness builds character with every sip. Mouthfeel is medium at best with creaminess that melts away quickly. All in all, a true beauty of a beer. Compares favorably to St. Bernardus Abt 12."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 80)",5,"I am not going to describe one of the greatest achievements of this endeavor that is brewing.

All I can say is thank you God."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 81)",4.5,"330ml glass bottle dated as best before 20/02/2024 from Vini Vivi wine store in West Hampstead. Aged for about six months since purchased. Served into an oversized wine glass having been becoming up to room temperature from refrigeration for over 30 minutes.

The beer pours a medium brown with light bleeding through at the edges giving it a reddish tint. A three finger tan head that dissipates down surprisingly quickly. Lots and lots of micro bubbled streams of carbonation. The carbonation eases out over the life of the drink quite dramatically. Almost taking it to flat bitter level by the final gulp. 

The aroma has a noticeable alcohol presence, which is not surprising for eleven percent beer. Ripe banana, coriander, caramel malt and raisin are prominent. Definitely in the Belgian tradition.

The taste is extremely well balanced and moreish without ever being overstated. Caramel malt, spicy coriander. Sweet sugar, raisins and prunes. A little yeast. The slightest hop bitterness. Very easy going on the palate for such high ABV. 

The alcohol continues to warm long after the glass is empty. Nice mouthfeel, some sweetness lingers on the palate. Sugar and a little banana. 

Overall, an outstanding beer. Top marks to those monks."

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 85)",4.1,"Odori e profumi speziati, in particolare liquirizia e caramello. Gusto complesso, vinoso e affumicato per via del malto scuro, carbonazione abbondante. L'alcol si sente abbastanza, non troppo, ma lo si avverte soprattutto a fine sorso; chiude e bilancia il dolce complessivo con un leggero amarognolo resinoso."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 86)",3.2,"Aroma of prunes, plum & raisins. Clear reddish brown with a very low tanned head. Medium sweet with a burning feeling from the high alcohol which though gives a very long finish. Medium body, slick texture & average carbonation."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 87)",4.2,"Very complex quadruple. Many different flavors come to mind such as chocolate and caramel. Three-finger foam. Very light hops flavor. Really pleasant taste which pairs well with the high ABV, but I have to say I generally like beers with high alcohol content so it may not be for everyone. All in all a very good beer."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 88)",4.3,A high quality complex quadruple. Super boozy. A great beer but i prefer the westy12 as to me that has more body. Great though and this won't disappoint. I also enjoy the beer more as the carbonation lessons. More flavour released. Up rating after another bottle enjoyed.

W aromacie brzoskwinie, rodzynki, melasa, ciasto nasączane rumem. 
Dobrze nasycone. O puszystej fakturze. W smaku jest słodko, ale bez przesady. Są też owoce: brzoskwinia, morela. Rodzynki, melasa, biszkopt. Delikatna skórkowa goryczka.

Taste: raisin, pear, caramel, some spice, medium-high sweetness, medium bitterness.
Palate: medium-full body, medium carbonation, medium-high dryness, medium-high booziness 
Overall: The drinkability is really low because of its booziness. The flavor is strong and characteristic of a quadrupel though. Ok."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 91)",5,"Every time i tried this beer, it seems better and better. And this fact show me that i dont know how good it is. When the beer stops to impressing me.. Every time it gives me more things. The beer is so complex and definitely you cant undrestand it for a single try.
Anyway the aroma is one of the best out there. It trap you and dont let you go. Is so smooth with so much depth. So many dark fruits and sweet caramel there. But the taste is really insane. In secs the beer embrace your tongue and warm it with pleasand sweet fruity notes. The mouthfeel is incredible and almost the same good like Westvleteren 12. The beer is very fruity and sweet. Berries, plums  chocolate, caramel and all these together make one amazing taste. The finish has one warm bittersweet aftertaste. Also you get little wine flavour there. The carboration is great and push the beer in your stomach perfectly. And lastly you dont believe this beer has 11.3% alcohol.
Overall one of the most balance beers out there. Really the beer is perfect and hasent weakness. This and Westvleteren 12 are in the same level. And you can get it very easy with reasonable price. So in that case we get lucky. So make sure you get one bottle soon! 5 Big Stars!!"
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 92)",4.3,"Pours a deep mahogany coloration with a reddish tint and a medium, frothy head, with visible carbonation. Smells of bready, caramel malt and distinct dark fruit, with notes of raisin and plum, as well as some chocolate and estery spice, with hints of clove and allspice. Taste is an excellent balance of bready, caramel malt, brown sugar, dark fruit, with notes of raisin and plum, chocolate, some estery spice, with notes of clove, vanilla and licorice, as well as hints of bitter, herbal hops. Finsihes bittersweet, with a medium sweetness, light bitterness and some caramel malt, dark fruit and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and medium carbonation.

Probably my favorite everyday Quadrupel, only coming in just behind Westvleteren 12, which certainly isn't worth the quintuple price point. What I love about this personally is that it feels a little bit more bitter and spicy than its contemporaries, while also being quite rich, although perhaps just a tad too boozy at the same time. Overall this makes for a very rich and well-balanced Quadrupel that's quite hard to beat at its availability and price point. Perhaps a little too boozy, but making up for that with its more bitter and spicy accents, never feeling quite too sweet, as many other examples of the style."

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"(2, 99)",5,"""O temps ! Suspends ton vol""... Il y a certaines dégustations que l'on voudrait éternelles. Cette Rochefort 10 en fait partie. Tout est là, équilibre, puissance, intensité pour une bière qui n'est pas des plus facile à appréhender. Il m'aura fallu 999 dégustations pour commencer à la comprendre. Et je dis bien commencer, car des dizaines de dégustations de cette merveille ne suffirait pas à la comprendre totalement. Tout comme les autres bières trappistes belges, on y découvre bien entendu cette maîtrise que seules plusieurs générations ont réussi à atteindre. Mais cette Rochefort 10 est plus difficile d'accès, même par rapport à une Westleveren, tant son alliance est spécifique et son équilibre complexe. Au début de mon voyage initiatique, je ne l'appréciais donc que peu, ne sachant pas le décoder. Il faut donc croire que j'ai été bien formé, et en cela je remercie Corkyrory qui m'a accompagné et qui m'accompagne encore. Cette dégustation lui est donc dédicacée, cela est à la fois un remerciement et un hommage. Et sans nul doute qu'il serait capable de parler bien mieux que moi de cette Rochefort. Visuellement c'est un joli brun qui se présente à nous, surmonté d'une mousse beige de 5 mm. Le nez est un feu d'artifice : prune, pruneau, réglisse, girofle, pointe de chocolat, pomme, poire, vin madérisé et un alcool bien tonique se mêlent dans un cocktail puissant, élégant riche, complexe. À la dégustation, même explosion avec une tension en bouche remarquable. Superbe équilibre à l'attaque avec l'anis et la réglisse qui ressortent légèrement du lot. La deuxième bouche es5 superbe avec un alcool se renforçant et une complexité exceptionnelle. Sur l’arrière-bouche, pruneau et réglisse prennent quelque peu l'ascendant avec un alcool au maximum de son intensité, permettant force et contraste. Le final est long et distingué…une merveille."

Pours dark brown, near black, with a brown head that fades into splotchy lacing. Oily in the glass just like the other Hunah's. Nose was oak, apple brandy, with hints of chocolate and vanilla. Taste follows with present barrel notes providing warmth but no heat. The vanilla and cocoa are prominent, but the chili peppers were barely noticeable. A dry note from the cocoa hits mid-palate with a touch of cinnamon before the apple brandy barrel takes over in the finish. As much as I wanted to rant and rave about this one, it might be my least favorite of the Hunah variants that I have tried. Still fun to try and glad I did!"

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(1, 21)",3.7,"32 oz. screw-top growler graciously shared by Dave. Originally reviewed 6/29/2012.

Pours an incredibly flat inky black. Glass-staining, as always. Viscous, but no head. Bummer. Growler, maybe?

Nose is brandy, booze, and, well, standard Hunahpu aromas. Chilies and chocolate. And more booze. The brandy aroma is a little on the sickly sweet side, though. Really detracts, I think.

Tastes awfully sweet at the start. Brandy comes through, but it isn’t an imposing flavor, except for the sweetness. Chocolate and chilies are still pretty potent in this treatment. Thick and sweet and syrupy, though. Every bit of sugar is amplified by the brandy.

Thick and boozy. Still has the wonderful viscosity of Hunahpu, though, but it tastes every bit of 11.5% and then some. The sugar doesn’t help.

Not an impressive treatment. It’s still a fascinating combination of flavors, but not something that improves upon the original beer."

Aroma is fairly light with the vegy chilli , roast, dark chocolate and caramel. Flavor is moderate to heavy sweet and bitter. The palate as well is somewhat subdued, maybe from the age. It’s lovely, but subtle. The apple brandy aspects come out lightly but nothing much. Full bodied with soft carbonation. Great, but so subtle compared to the fresh normal huna drunk side by side."

Doubt the blackness-scale has anything blacker than this and it has a small quickly sidesticking really really deep dark brown top. Lovely nose with chocolate, apples, vanilla, wood, and it’s actually so deep and intense that it’s a little scary. Yeah I said it, I’m a little scared. It’s super smooth in the mouth! Thick, chewy and almost syrupy oily with a soft really prickling and stingy carbonation. It has a pure chocolaty liquefied roasty flavor. Oh my. There is also a soft sharpness in the finish here. Only subtle nuances of apple, wood, vanilla, raspberries and dark cocoa powder. One of the best I’ve had in a long time (and I have recently had some pretty incredible stuff). Huge thanks Josh!

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(1, 37)",4.4,"Original review (2012-07-16): Gloops from the bottle as any Zhukov-based brew should. Tremendous roast in the nose with brandy and caramely notes. Lots of complexity here, though I wish it were more pungent. 



Taste is marvelously complex with brandy, booze, vanilla, spice, and plenty more that end up dancing atop the delicious stout base. Chiles are mild, where they belong. The trademark Hunahpu’s chocolate, vanilla, and chile aftertaste gets a boost from the brandy as it tickles the back of my throat upon swallowing. Ultra-viscous body, as expected, and just amazing.

Bottle 57/84. Opaque black beer, thick dark brown head that dies away quickly. Softish semi dry palate. When cold it’s all about the soft creamy chocolate with dashes of coffee and molasses. As it warms up other  flavours appear - wood and vanilla sweetness. The apple brandy is quite subtle but provides a fruity sour undertone. Gets a little stronger towards the finish and is in balance with the chocolate and coffee. This is a lovely beer but I’m surprised how high in the top 50 it is."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(1, 62)",4.8,"Poured from a 32 oz. growler into a snifter.

Like the regular Hunahpu’s, the Apple Brandy Barrel Aged Hunahpu’s pours a viscous dark black chocolate color with a barely noticeable tan head around the ring of the glass.

The aroma is full, complex, and somehow elevated beyond the greatness the original Hunahpu’s achieves.  The brandy is noticeable and seems to gently overlay the other aromas, which are consistent with the regular Hunahpu’s: dark chocolate, a bit of espresso, vanilla, with a bit of pepper and a slightly fruity apple presence.

Each sip is nearly perfect.  The dark chocolate fudge, roasted malt, and creamy espresso notes all blend amazingly well with a brandy flavor.  The middle of the sip contains the zenith of its complexity, with the apple coming through, mixing with oak and vanilla from the barrel, and a bit of residual chocolate flavor.  The end of the sip wraps the treat up nicely, leaving a nice brandy flavor in my mouth.

The brandy mellows out the sticky sweetness that the base beer contains, and the barrel definitely lightens up the carbonation a little bit as well.  It is creamy and smooth, with the brandy cutting through the thickness of Hunahpu’s as well.  This beer really just has the perfect body, carbonation, and smoothness that I am looking for.

After tasting Hunahpu’s for the first time I did not think there was any way to improve on it, but after having the whiskey and the brandy, I have changed my opinion.  This is such an incredible beer."

A: Thick as motor oil. No head. Legs on the glass like the lamp from A Christmas Story.

N: Intense caramel, cotton candy, brown sugar, coffee, fudge. This is mostly sugar, though, hence the score.

T: Good god. Diabetes. Cinnamon, chocolate, coffee, a little bit of soy sauce. A very slight pepper. Lots of dark fruits. Alcohol is well hidden. Pretty much the epitome of throw everything into the kettle. 

M: Heaviest beer I’ve ever tried. A little bit of carbonation. Expands and contracts all over my palate.

O: There’s almost no apple brandy so deducting some points there. Honestly, this is amazing, and then it’s way too much.

Aroma is compared to the regular Huna less driven by the added flavourings but reminds more of a ""regular"" imp stout. Lots of chocolate, oak, vanilla and sweet fruit. I miss the chili from the regular one. Same flavours dominate the taste with maybe just a tiny hint of the chili. Decent amount of sweetness and raw sugars. Very viscous, full body with low carbonation. Absolutely delicious, but I think I prefer the original."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(1, 67)",4.7,"Poured from tap into CCB snifter.

Just like the regular version, pours used motor oil. Blacker than black. A good inch of head that has nice retention. Leaves nice lacing. This is my favorite hunahpu variation, with the rum right behind it. The latest batch is even better than previous batches."

Dark viscous black pour with very dark chocolate brown head, aroma has notes of green apple, brandy, some booze, big dark chocolate, coffee, spices, roast, but mostly barrel with some slight chili.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(1, 78)",4.2,"Growler shared by Armin.  Thanks for a cool one!  Pour is as dark as anything I have ever seen.  Viscous, pitch black, very dark mocha head, that fades to a small skim with a bit of sticky lacing.  Aroma is all barrel.  Booze, brown sugar, light chili heat right at the very end.  Not much of the base beer makes it through.  The taste though...wow.  Perfect blend of chocolate, lots of chocolate, more chocolate, some smoke, earth, a bit of spicy chili heat,  light wood, brown sugar and booze.  Thick mouthfeel and a lasting finish. Great, great taste, but the aroma doesn’t do it for me."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(1, 79)",4.2,"Big fliptop shared by Tooch. Thanks, buddy. Really exciting beer to finally try. Pours a rich inky black thick pour, a small dark brown head atop dies to a ring, laces small. Thick and inky, dark and ominous. Aromas are richer chocolate chip cookies, cocoa, and biscuits. Touches of oak, vanilla, and touches of apples grow. Cocoa, coffee, and vanilla, gentle spirit, touches of dark fruit. A gentle kiss of spice. Initial is fuller bodied, with cocoa and caramel, smoothed out barrel elements offer oak, vanilla, and some mellow apple brandy spirit. Smooth spirit, brandy, and oak, well integrated with richer fudge, roast, and mellow coffee roast. Smooth, the barrel integrates well with a kiss of spice. A very well done barrel aged stout, firm sweetness countered with a touch of thinness with barrel, oak, and brandy. Vanilla, touches of roast, toast, smokey elements still stick around. No real spice. But smokey, smooth and silky, with a good barrel presence that integrates well. It loses the base nature of the beer, but still tastes great. I’m still out the Bourbon version, but so far, this one of my favorite barrel variant of the series. Very nice."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(1, 83)",5,"32oz growler from the most recent release with HUGE thanks to a great FL friend and an amazing FL trader. thanks a ton, guys! i’m a fairly eloquent guy and as you can see from my ratings, a bit verbose but this beer brought me to a level where the only words i could utter were ""fuck me sideways, this is perfect"". yeah, it’s that good.

pours as only a CCB imperial stout can. thick as motor oil but silky smooth capped by a rich, dense, red-clay colored head that stains the hell out my Hunahpu’s snifter and leaves beautiful rings of lace. aroma is nothing short of divine with all that is great about the base beer...dense dark chocolate, heavy roast, a touch of toasted cedar, burnt cinnamon, smoked chilis, molasses, and espresso backed by elegant notes of wet oak, baked cinnamon apples, and sweet, boozy brandy that really pops as it warms in the glass. flavor is a near out-of-body experience with the oak, sweet brandy, and subtle apple notes complimenting and adding a level of complexity to the heavy dark chocolate fudge, espresso, vanilla, cinnamon, and smoked notes of the base Hunahpu’s but allowing the rich toasted cedar and mild chili spice to still shine on the back end. palate is sheer perfection as well with the bold, imposingly thick, yet smooth as silky mouthfeel i’ve come to love in the base Hunahpu’s with a long, lingering finish of subtle chili spice, dark chocolate, and sweet brandy. overall, this may be the single best beer i’ve ever tasted. it’s an absolute marvel and a testament to barrel aging. wow."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(1, 84)",5,"Stumbled across this while picking up a case of Barrel aged church on the hill at the Cigar City tasting room yesterday.  I asked what they had in the unmarked tap handle and  the bartender said ’’ apple brandy barrel aged hunahpu’’. After I picked myself off the floor I ordered 2 snifters, sat down and was in awe. The aroma, totaly unique, ballanced smokey sweet, chocolate spice. Tasted just as unique with the peper ballanced perfectly to give you a warm swallow of smooth greatness. This is the most exceptional beverage Ive ever had. My expcetations were high, and this exceeded on every level.  IMHO, the nectar of the godz. , perfect!"
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(1, 85)",4.3,"Growler sent from an awesome regular trading partner, thanks Dave! Pours a pitch black in color with a small amount of dark brown head. Nose is light on the apple brandy, but it’s there. There is chocolate, malt, vanilla, brandy, boozy, cracker, and cinnamon. The apple brandy is subdued in the flavor as well, but it layers the base beer nicely. In comparison to the brandy Zhukov, this is far more balanced. Mouthfeel is medium to thick, with good carbonation, and a long finish. Lives up to the hype, another superb barrel treatment of Hunahpu. The apple brandy compliments the base beer (which is an unreal imperial stout) very well."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(1, 86)",4.7,"Big thanks to Adam on this one.  Aroma: lots of chocolate and vanilla, cinnamon, slight hints of the apple brandy, molasses, cocoa, fairly sweet, noticeable alcohol.  Pours like black ink, very viscous, faint brown head dissipates fairly quickly.  Flavor is fantastic - starts with a hefty dose of chocolate, like chocolate cake without being overly sweet.  Apple notes, some warming alcohol, earthy/woody hints, coffee, molasses, roast malts, medium bitterness with minimal hop character.  The vanilla is fairly pronounced and the cinnamon is certainly present, the heat from the peppers has dissipated compared to the base, but is still just barely lurking in the background.  Extremely full bodied without being overly sweet, just the right amount of carbonation, very smooth and silky.  An excellent beer, glad I was able to try it."

The beer pours a black color with a huge brown head. The aroma has a ton of chocolate in it, as well as some roasted malt, oak and brandy. The flavor is similar. Upfront I get a ton of sweet apple brandy notes, with some chocolate and roasted malt coming through as well. I get a hint of spiciness and pepper, but the brandy and chocolate come through the strongest. Thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Awesome."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(1, 88)",4.1,"Growler, big thanks Kan. Aroma of paper, caramel, cinnamon, dark chocolate bar, chilies, sweet green apple. Flavors are sweet caramel and apples but good burst of chilies, dark chocolate, raisin, and spicy finish. Thick body. Getting some slight papery oxidation but hurts it a bit. Not sure it’s better than the base or the bourbon but it’s really tasty."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(1, 89)",4,"Very dark brown and inky.  The aroma is rich, with lots of imperial stout malty goodness, lots of sugar but maybe not as much barrel.  The distinctive Huny notes don’t really show through here.  Very sweet and candyish, with subtle apple and rich caramel.  I like it.  Very sugary and rich, the chile is I think totally lost, however.  The apple brandy barrel doesn’t show through as distinctively as the bourbon or Palm Ridge barrels do.  But you can’t say it’s not serious business."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(1, 90)",4.8,"First and foremost, thank you Adam! 

Smells like a really sweet hunahpus, seriously. The chocolate and cinnamon are present but the chili is very subdued, although I can still get the heat a little on the back of my tongue. Taste is very rich and sweet. Almost fudge like. Definitely get the brandy and slight tart. This is just outstanding. Some vanilla in there for sure. Somewhat roasty as well. I love it. Better than the original."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(1, 91)",3.6,Sampled at small peen.  I just had after regular Hunahpu.  I hated it.  This definitely takes the edge off the pepper.  Brandy is gentle but cannot over come the negatives of the pepper.  Not a strong enough base.  For me anyway.
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(1, 92)",4,"Growler. Viscous inky think unctuous black. Huge chalky sweet woody rich mint chocolate white chocolate coffee crumble. Soft. Oily. Hunapuh spice masala late. Early flavors dark chocolate, sweet plum seems muddled at first because palate needs to attenuate to appreciate and to notice the cinnamon. But then when the tongue is coated, yum. Not as smooth and sublime as original but yummy and fun.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(1, 93)",4.4,"Growler (6/18/12) shared by umr_urgefan- thanks again, Paul! Pours an inky, dark, opaque brown with almost no head whatsoever. Aroma of vanilla, chocolate, oak, berries, apples, molasses, caramel, and soy. Flavor of vanilla, caramel, cola, oak, chocolate, brown sugar, molasses, and then some subtle smoke and peat on the finish, maybe with a hint of the spices. The spice from the base beer is very subdued here. Medium-full bodied, with a silky smooth mouthfeel and low-moderate carbonation. Pretty damn sweet. The barrel takes over in this one. Excellent, and looking forward to having it again in a few weeks. Re-Rate: Well, it’s been a few weeks, so we had it again along with a 2010 bottle (number 37 of 84) that was shared by Sean9669- thanks, Sean! The 2010 wasn’t quite as tasty as the 2012; it had smooth apple brandy, molasses, vanilla, caramel, and oak in the nose; the flavor was just as smooth and rich, with low carbonation. It just didn’t pop like the 2012, which is every bit as good as the regular, whiskey, and bourbon Hunahpu’s, and which was the overall winner for our tasting group. It’s just a little too sweet for me to put it above those other three, but it’s damn good. A singular drinking experience."

Beer is black with a nice tan head, small bubbles, lacing, low carbonation, decent retention.

Aroma is hunahpu’s base, chocolate, sweet, mild spice, with this incredibly layered liquor, this smells perfect.

I’m cautioning myself from giving this a perfect 5 but it is damn close. Nice body, medium, creamy, coats the mouth almost completely, mildly roasty, sweet liquor up front, mild fruitiness, chocolate and fudge on the palate. An awesome beer."

Bottle 61 / 84

The beer is black. The appearance is oily and viscous. Atop the beer rests an inch of dense, beige head that hangs out for the duration. Cigar City sure makes some good looking stouts.

The aroma offers less cinnamon and spice than the standard Hunahpu’s. Beautiful dark roast and chocolate aromas, along with oak, vanilla, and a light boozy sweetness.

The flavor is fantastic. The brandy character gains momentum as the beer is allowed to warm. Well balanced, teeming with flavor, complex, unique. Yeah man. Another amazing stout from Cigar City. What a treat."

A - Pours absolutely pitch black with a small dark brown head that leaves sticky brown lacing down most of the glass.




S - A bit on the sweet side with a strong aroma of brandy. A bit of chocolate and some sort of spices? Could that be the chillies from the non-BA version? I might need another glass to determine if it is...




T - Starts out with some mild sweetness from the apple brandy slowly developing into an amazing line-up of cinnamon, chocolate, and some faint spices. Most of the things I don’t like about the normal version of hunahpu’s are all cleared up with the barrel aging. Absolutely one of the best stouts I have ever had. I can only hope to have it again in the future.




M - Heavy body and flavor with good carbonation. It has a very full body but it is very well rounded. The brandy flavor is strong but not too overpowering.




O - I could drink this all day. I drank it side by side with regular version and it was like drinking a completely different beer. This one was so much more complex and smooth. Absolutely amazing. So glad I got to try this one."

Taste is all the cocoa and vanilla from the original, apple brandy, cinnamon, alcohol, 70% chocolate, intense dark fruits, figs, dates, coffee, some dry oak qualities. Much smoother and mellow than the original. I don’t get the medicinal quality in this one, which is a big improvement. I like this better than original, not as hot and medicinal at all.

Not sure if the ba adds anything here, would really need to have them back to back...The taste is utterly awesome, especially as it warms up just brings out more and more flavors; chocolate, chili peppers, and wood, can’t really pull out any of the apple brandy.

T-roasted malts up front with notes of chocolate cake and a touch of wood.  the brandi comes in behind as the strong malts move sweet.  the spices of thanksgiving are underneath with the back end offering sweet dark plums and cherries.

M-full bodied and chewy, this is extremely thick, a real sipper.  assertively carbonated to balance the robust body not losing anything from the barrel.

D-extremely well balanced with great complexity and fantastic flavors. i true sipper that provides full flavors that are well integrated and uniquely crafted.  Best CC beer I’ve had and actually lives up to the hype."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 25)",3.9,"A: The pour is almost black with a nice viscosity and almost no head.

S: There’s a slightly metallic note at first, but it seems to diminish as the beer sits in the glass. I get a lot of chocolate to begin with. The chili note is there, too, but is sort of overwhelmed by the oak, brandy, roast, and coffee.

T: Surprisingly oaky at the first sip. There’s some nice brandy flavor here and the barrel provides some spicy notes and tannins. Quite a bit of milk chocolate and a nice chili flavor in the background.

M: The body is medium to full with a low, but smooth carbonation.

D: I think I actually still like the regular Hunahpu’s the best, but this was quite good. I wouldn’t turn down another glass of this."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 27)",4.1,"(Bottle, one million thanks to beerlando) Pours super black with a small dark brown head. The aroma holds well-integrated brandy, but I don’t know if it makes the beer better? Lots of chocolate/ cocoa and aromatic coffee with a nice, more subtle backup from the spices. Undertones of apple, dried fruits/prunes, tobacco, vanilla, coconut and wood alongside a light milkiness. The roast is not super aggressive, yet light burned. The hops are not over the top, it just makes it more complex. Fruity with notable alcohol warmth. Very peppery as the beers gets warmer. Some teriyaki on the nose. The flavour is near medium sweet, medium bitter and tiny acidic The taste is a nice mix of dark bitter chocolate, brandy, mild chilly spices, heavy roasted malt and light molasses. The mouthfeel is super fat, oily and smooth with a light, soft carbonation. Burned malt, balanced hops and buttery oak lingers in the finish. Full bodied. Near fantastic, but I like the regular Hunahpu better."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 28)",4.5,"Cigar city brandy hunahpus (bottle number 65 of 84). Thanks to Sean.  In celebration of his engagement and my 2000th rating... Pours a smooth  
viscous deep black pour, silky in nature, with a thin wispy dark khaki  
head... Aroma is laiden with sweet brandy forwardness, semi- 
bittersweet velvety chocolate, while the chiles are still quite  
apparent and noticeable which is equally impressive for that matter. Some char and  
light ash from the base Zhukov providing some complimentary details to an already beautiful nose... Flavors are a smooth transition from  
the aroma with an equally rich and assertive profile. Semi-charred  
from the base Zhukov which then evolves to a richer atmosphere with brandy  
along with its fruity esthers. Chocolate tones are quite evident, so  
rich and so smooth and semi-sweet in nature. Chiles surface every now  
and again which is a pleasant surprise as I was expecting for this quality to have fallen off due to its age and time spent in the barre. Body is thick and filling, almost  
fudgy. Carbonation is light but noticeable. Abv is slightly warming overall but really held at bay for the most part. Quite the experience and  
well worth it for such a milestone.

Nose of brandy, vanilla bean, assorted chilis and cocoa powder. Taste is simply divine and can best be described as assorted chili peppers wrapped in cocoa leaves resting on a bed of vanilla beans. Some oak and brandy are present giving a deeper character to the beer. Short and to the point, it tastes like a rich, chili-infused milkshake. Simply amazing!"
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 30)",4.3,"On tap at CCB during the Hunahpu’s release party. 

A: Look was very similar to regular Hunahpu’s, as well as bourbon Hunahpu’s, which made for some fun at the table. Very dark black with a very rich deep tan head and a pretty good amount of lacing. 

S: The smell of brandy is immediately present alongside all of those other beautiful scents that come along with the regular version. It’s quite nice and not overpowering, but at the same time I’m not sure it really complements the essence of the Hunahpu’s all that much. Left me wondering whether a ""Humidor Series"" Hunahpu’s would have been even more outstanding. Still, very beautiful nose that I won’t actually complain about.

T: Very similar assessment to the nose. The brandy actually did work pretty well, and I think this is true more so for the taste than the nose; however, still not quite a perfect 5. Again, didn’t like the taste as much as the standard Hunahpu’s, as I felt that some of the more subtle flavors from the original version might have a bit lost.

M: Superb. Very thick and viscous and good carbonation for the style. 

D: Very beautiful. Although not nearly as drinkable as the standard version, that one was well past the standard 5.0, so I have no problem giving that to the brandy version as well. Just a beautiful sipping beer.

Serving type: on-tap

First things first, HUGE props to Eric.  What a great guy--Brings a phenomenal beer to share with the masses.  Secondly, CCB knocks it out again with another version of beer ""art.""  Black body pours out and is topped with a cappucino-colored head. It’s sticky and is very leggy.  Aromas of dark chocolates, roasty, vanilla, milk chocolate, spices, some alcohol, espresso and a spicy finish. Flavor is intense and combines everything from the aromas into an amazing, ever-evolving palpable, chewy palate.  A hint of alcohol shows up later in the game.  I’ve only tasted the BA CCB beers and would love to have an entire bottle to myself (maybe share with my wife;-).  It’s extraordinary for me to think about how the individual ingredients can come together to make a finished product that can be so complex and have so much character, depth and literally, personality.

Some tobacco and leather in the taste as well. A very intense sipper that is pretty well done.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 49)",4,"On tap at hawthornes. 8oz pour in tulip glass.
A: Pitch black. No head, no skim, no lacing. Just a thick motor oil look alike.

S: Light apple brandy lays atop the profile from start to finish. Underneath are spicy chili peppers, cinnamon, roasted malt, cocoa and traces of vanilla and oak.

T: Like the nose, its clear right away that the beer was treated with some time in apple brandy barrels. It isn;t overwhelming however and complements the rich spicy flavors of the base beer well. Chili peppers pop out on the tongue and are rounded out with sweet cinnamon, cocoa, vanilla and a bit of caramel.

M: Thick and smooth. Lightly carbonated (in a good way). A bit of warming heat, but not overpoweringly boozy.

O: I plowed through this beer fairly quickly (unintentionally). It just went down real well despite its massive body and substantial flavoring. As noted above this was much better than the pour I got the day before at Capones. Its amazing how different they were. Capones was almost all brandy, killing off the peppers and cinnamon. The Hawthorne’s sample really was like Hunahpus + Apple Brandy... which was nice to get. Cigar City guys... do you guys know what happened to the Capone’s keg???"
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 50)",3,"Thanks for sharing this rarity, Nick.

Black as pitch and quite viscous, there isn’t much of a head, but it does have nice legs.

It smells strangely muddled. Bittersweet dark chocolate, a touch of tart apple, some leathery oxidation. The barrel aging seems to have actually simplified the beer and covered up most of the pepper, vanilla and cinnamon. As it warms, it becomes dominated by heavily roasted, tarry, almost burnt malt and sweet brandy. Not bad, but haphazard.

The apple brandy flavor comes through pretty strongly on the palate. It hints at apple, but it’s more of an indistinguishable fruity sweetness. There’s a little vanilla and oak, lots and lots of bitter baking chocolate, barely perceptible chili pepper. This is a huge, chewy imperial stout, almost Dark Lord-esque in viscosity. The finish is mildly boozy with lingering flavors of bitter chocolate, licorice, earthy oxidation and faint chili pepper. Barrel aging seems to have covered up the boldness of the adjunct ingredients in this beer, transforming it into something that’s enjoyable but ultimately muddled. Perhaps Hunahpu’s wasn’t the best beer to put in a barrel. Pretty good, I enjoyed my glass, but it’s not outstanding. There are a number of better and less rare barrel aged imperial stouts out there."

Pours pitch black with a tan head that fades to thick but spotty foam.  Some legs - this is very thick.  Aroma is absolutely amazing.  Rich chocolate, roast, caramel, oak, and brandy.  Super intense.  Flavor is Hunahpu’s and brandy.  That doesn’t sound great, but it was AWESOME!  Roast, rich dark chocolate, toffee, coffee, oak, brandy, vanilla, cinnamon, and chili peppers.  So much going on.  One of the best and most complex RISes I’ve had, and that’s saying something!  It’s my favorite style and I’ve ticked well over 100.  On the palate, wow, this is very heavy, like Guinness almost.  ALMOST.  Syrupy and slick with very full body.  Mouthfeel is really the only place it fails.  Otherwise it’s incredible.  Oh, and drinkability I guess.  I took down my 5oz or so with no problem, but may not want all that much more.  But otherwise, damn dogg, this is legit!

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 53)",3.6,"thanks to shadesofgrey for this rarity. i guess. completely flat, not a bubble to be seen in this viscous pour. completely flat in the mouth, just seems more like a strong prune-ish port or something. maybe there is some cool stuff from the apple brandy barrel, but the absolute flatness and staleness of it make me not even want to seek anything out. hopefully i can rerate this in the future from something other than a hand bottle. 

edit/re-rate: ok this is weird. the first pour from this hand bottle was dead still, and the second one has some light carbonation and some head. weird. head is super dark brown, one of the darkest i’ve seen. the aroma is about the same, very distracted by heat, but good. however, just the bit of carbonation really opens up the myriad of subtleties in it. sweet apples, hot peppers, licorice, cacoa, etc. still a bit flat in the mouth, i imagine i might rate this another 0.2 -0.6 higher if it was in proper order."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 55)",4.2,"16oz hand bottle. Holy god... this beer looks sexy as hell in the glass. Super thick and viscous with about the darkest brown head of any beer I’ve ever seen. A gentile swirl in the glass leaves a slightly golden brown motor oil stain on the sides of my glass. As with the bourbon version, the barrel aging mutes some of the original awesomeness of the aroma. Very light pepper/chili notes. Fairly heavy on the alcohol, but thankfully the stink of isovaleric acid that was so prevalent in the bourbon version is absent here. Mild wet wood notes. The vanilla and peppers come up a bit more as the beer nears room temperature. Decent... but fairly average barreled aroma. The barrel shows itself much more on the tongue than on the nose. Lush flavors of peppers, vanilla, decadent milk chocolate, toasted nuts immediately come to the tongue. Further warming brings out the wood and brandy flavors. The base beer is pretty much gone with the barrel leaving a goddamn decadent imperial stout. Slightly tart granny smith apples, plenty of warming (but not distracting) alcohol, wet wood... Huge mouthfeel but never syrupy or cloying. Damn near reminiscent of cask Darkness. Ultra velvety and smooth throughout.  Bitter chocolate with a kiss of heat and wood tannin on the finish. 



 It’s been a very, very long time since I have been this impressed with an Imperial Stout (much less a Barrel Aged version) but make no mistake people, this is the real deal. Color me impressed. Thanks a ton Ryan!"

The aroma is fantastic and shows a complex blend of dark chocolate, brandy, vanilla, candied apples, and a dose of cinnamon spice. The ancho and pasilla chile peppers start to show on the back adding that spicy, peppery kick while the brandy oak ties it all together. The barrel really changes things offering sereval nuances to the beer. The flavor is just as decadent showing waves of dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and sweet candied apples. There is even some toasted coconut in there to go with the peppery spice on the back end that adds just a touch of heat. The signature sweet candied apples and vanilla shine through the most from the brandy barrel adding to the great flavor and depth of this brew.

Poured black with mocha edges to create a smallish head and good albeit surprisingly thin lacing. Nose is brandy, vanilla, chocolate, cocoa. Taste is a wonderful battle of the apple, brandy of the barrel and the chocolate, vanilla, pepper and especially the warming and booziness of the brew. The feel was creamy and almost chewy with a very nice level of carbonation to hold it up. Drinkability is also a battle between my desire and the abv. but price and availability probably push me over the edge. All-in-all a great imperial stout."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 62)",4.3,"6/5/10 on Tap at Capone’s.  Pours midnight black with no head and only a couple bubbles.  Aroma was solid cherry, apple and alcohol, with only hints of coffee.  As it warmed, you could pick up a bit of smokiness from the peppers and a touch of cinnamon, but the brandy still dominated.

Flavor was very sweet dark chocolate covered fruit.  Slightly dry smoky tobacco finish.  As it warmed, you got a bitt more flavor from the peppers and felt the slightest tingle on the tongue.

This is an incredibly smooth and drinkable imperial stout that needs no further age.  

Overall, this tasted like a solid imperial stout aged a bit too long in brandy.  However....

6/6/10 at Hawthorne Cafe: This was like a completely different beer.  I got a ton of pepper and smoke in the nose right from the start, but just balanced with the cinnamon and brandy.  This was much more balanced and tasted like what I would expect from taking a great base imperial stout (Hunahpu’s) and throwing it in brandy.  The aging was a great complement.

I’m not sure why such a disparity between the two kegs, but my rating is essentially my averaged impression of the two beers."

Pours black with no head with some fine legs, later glasses had a rich dark mocha cap.  Sweet, mild brandy on the nose, some lightly bitter chocolate, and a really pretty collage of sweet spices focusing on cinnamon.  Flavor starts out with some mildly sweet apple brandy, very soft, then blossoms into this amazing array of cinnamon, cardamom, maybe pumpkin.  Absolutely awesome.  The bitter, charred elements of the regular version were erased by the brandy barrel, but in contrast to some others I found the spices far more prominent in this one, especially the cinnamon.  A later pour near the bottom of the keg were a bit chalky and lost some of the glory of the first pour.  One of the best beers I’ve had, not really a classic imperial stout, but just amazingly expressive and the flavor progression was in my mind for the whole day."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 69)",4.7,"Draft at Capone’s with Pat. Pours a pitch black body with nice chocolate brown lacing. Aroma is sweet chocolate. Palate is medium feel dominated by sweet chocolate, vanilla bean, malt, and sweet brandy notes. No alcohol at all."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 70)",4.2,"5.5 oz. glass at Capone’s meet the Brewer & Owner of Cigar City. Pours a dark black with slight brownish-red head. Aroma is mild apple brandy, roasted malt & molasses . First sip is beautiful with vanilla, cocoa, roasted brown malt & slight hit of chili pepper in the finish but the brandy flavor balances it nicel with dark choclate flavors lingering.
Wonderful beer!"
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 71)",4.7,"...on tap at capone’s after a zhukov and original in the parking lot.Unfortunately the aroma has dropped off a lot with this aging, still there a bit with the brandy influence overall. The appearance is rich dark chocolatey, but the head dropped off a lot. The body is lighter and smoother than the original, with the cacao coming out and coconut throughout. Rerated on a growler from Alex and this is a different experience all together! The perfect aroma brings a sweet chocolate stout and sweet brandy booze, but the smoothest and most pleasant I could never have expected in this nose. There are delicious creamy cacao notes and the spices still remain muted from the barrel, but the chocolate flavors are shining just as well as they ever did. Truly phenomenal as CCB does as usual!"
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 72)",3.8,"RBWG. As with the Brandy Zhukov, I felt the barrel treatment hurt this beer more than it helped it. Still a big, burly imperial stout, however many of the more subtle notes of the Hunaphus—particularly the chili peppers, cinnamon—were no longer anywhere to be found, replaced with strong, boozy grape and licorice notes. A bit better than it’s brother, but still not a particularly notable effort to me."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 73)",4.5,"Draft at Hunahpu Day.  Just because this is a Wayne Wambles stout, it will be a 5 in both appearance and palate.  Just perfect.  Oily, viscous and thick with a deep tan head.  Aroma of sweet caramel apples and vanilla.  This barrel treatment almost removes any trace of the peppers.  The apple brandy gives a great sweet caramel flavor and some of the apple flavors you would expect, with the strong roasted flavors of the stout lingering in the background.  This is a great beer, but I find the regular Hunahpu’s and the Bourbon Hunahpu’s a little better.  The sweetness from the apple brandy is just a little too much.  Still, an elite brew."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 74)",4.5,"Draft at the Hunahpu Release Party. Pours a menacing pitch black color that actually sucks light in and wont release it. Less than one finger creamy tan yellow head that settles nicely on top of the beer. Aroma is pure goodness: Lightly roasty, chocolate, brandy, vanilla, wood, light smoke, ripe dark fruit, molasses, some hints of toffee and brown sugar. Flavor is about the same with a little more heat from the chilis and a little more brandy and booziness. Full body with a  boozy and malty finish. I think I still liked Bourbon Hunahpu best, but with some more time in the barrel, this beer would be even more spectacular."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 75)",4.8,"On draft at the Hunahpu release.  Pours evil midnight black, the definition of darkness itself, with barely an off-white head to speak of.  Nose is roast, brandy sweetness, barrel, vanilla, pepper, spice, dark fruits, and lots of cinnamon.  Flavor is chocolate- dark and sweet, vanilla, oak, brandy, cinnamon, a miniscule amount of heat, and a bit of earthy bite from the peppers.  Better than bourbon Hunahpu- almost tied with regular Hunahpu."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 76)",4.2,"Draft, a nice treatment however this beer is way better out of the barrel!  Pours a black body with a coffee tan head.  Peppers, rich sweet brandy and again a nice pepper spice complementing the warming.  Roast y pepper, vanilla, creme brulee, and mild coffee tones.  A mild warming thanks to those awesome peppers.  I mean overall the base beer is phenomenal there’s just no way masking some of its complexities made this a better experience."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 77)",4,"On draft at Hunahpus Release Party.  Aroma was sweet fruit, caramel and a hint of brandy.  Take the Hunahpu and add a hint of brandy and you have this beer. Great beer!!!"
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 78)",3.8,"Draft… RBWG ‘10… Pours thick and pitch black with a small, fizzy, light brown head. The fruity, chocolaty, cinnamon nose also provides diminished acrid, burnt and carbonaceous notes. Full-bodied and oily with lazy carbonation. The flavor offers cinnamon, chocolate and sweet apple brandy. Acrid bitterness supplies adequate balance. Lengthy, roasted, warming finish. I’m a much bigger fan of whiskey barrel aged beers."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 82)",4.3,"Draft at the brewery.  Pours as dark as night, resembling an oil slick more than beer with all it’s dense viscosity.  A thick and lasting head of dark brown foam leaves behind a glass staining wash of suds and bubbles.  In short, it looks damn perfect.  The nose is just ridiculous, showing a complex and complimentary blend of dark cocoa, vanilla, creamy coconut, and candied apples.  Of course, the anchos and pasillas shine through, along with the cinnamon, to complete the signature peppery Hunahpu aroma that has been ever so slightly kissed by the rich brandy oak.  Flavors too are mighty fine, showing wave after decadent wave of rich dark chocolate, caramel, cafe mocha, and even glazed donuts.  Coconut again makes an appearance, which is one of my favorite things about this beer.  Lightly peppery, the zestiness seems to have been cut down a little by the sweet apple barrel, but you can still pick it out.  On the palate, this stuff is as thick and rich as they come, proudly displaying a whipped, creamy body.  If there’s a flaw, it’s that there’s maybe a shade too much sweetness, but it is negligible.  As expected, this is a fantastic, world-class beer."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 84)",4.5,"A huge thanks to ArthurPendragon for flying out to FL, getting this growler filled, flying to Chicago, and meeting Alex at Midway just for us to sample this beer! You da man!

I was told the keg blew about 80% into the fill on this growler, so we did get pretty lucky! From a smallish (not sure the ounces) Cigar City Growler into a mini-snifter.

A - Pours black, super-oily resin along the sides of the glass, motor oil to the maximum. Some bubbles, but mostly, just a black. The sticky look of this beer looks cool, no doubt about it.

S - A perfect mix of sweet apples, brandy, and the base Hunahpu’s beer. The Laird’s complements the Hunahpu’s so well, it’s hard to describe how good this beer really is. I enjoyed the base beer so much alone, this was even better. You get the chili notes mixed in there as well, very complex.

T - Everything I got from the nose, I also got on the palate. I would say it’s even more complex on the palate. I can really taste all the different things going on with this beer. As complex as the base beer is, this is even moreso. Apple Brandy, chilis, molasses, toffee, burnt sugars, etc. 

M - Full bodied, slight carbonation, rich and smooth.

D - I had a decently-sized sample that I really enjoyed. I wanted more, but alas, there wasn’t enough after everyone got their pour. Who knows if I’ll ever try this again, probably not. This was an epic beer!

EDIT: To date, this is my highest rated Imperial Stout and 2nd highest of my entire drinking career.  Like I said, an epic beer!"
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 85)",4.5,"Draft @ Cigar City Brewing’s Hunahpu release. Pours black with creamy brown head.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 87)",4.4,"On tap at the Hunahpu’s Release Party. 
Probably my favorite treatment of this beer, except maybe for the bourbon aged version when it was first released several months back.
The beer is charcoal-black and pours thick and slowly, like cascading black lava, onto the snifter. Leaves about a 1/3 of an inch of foamy head at the top. Head has the color of fresh cappuccino. 
In the nose I get a lot of sweet brandy notes with hints of alcohol heat, but not overbearing at all. Also some very nice vanilla, caramelized sugar and toffee. 
The front palate gets that sweet brandy heat almost right away, followed by oak, dark chocolate, vanilla and in the back  that ancho chile that made hunahpu’s famous creeps in slowly.  
This is definitely a sipping beer, the mouth-feel is robust and substantial. Viscous. Extraordinary!"
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 88)",4.4,"Tap at CCB for the Hunahpus release.  Easily the best beer of the night IMHO and the best Hunahpus treatment I’ve had so far.  Both the nose and the flavor of this beer are complex and multi layered  the brandy is present in both but not over powering, more soft and subtle.  I really smell and taste all of the base Hunahpus ingredients with the brandy it’s very harmonious.  Huge notes of fudge, roasted malt, cinnamon, and vanilla blended very nicely with notes of brandy, wood, and mild char, at first the peppers are really only experienced in the back of the throat but as the beer warms the peppers become much more apparent in the flavor and nose giving it the character of a mole.  Huge creamy, velvety mouth feel, if you like big, full, chewy bodies as I do, I’d say this is perfect.  As the pitch black beer retreats it leaves my glass heavily stained as with all CCB stouts.  Finishes lightly sweet and roasted with a big hit of chocolate and cinnamon.  Excellent."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 91)",5,"Of all the Hunahpus treatments, this was my favorite by far.  The same dark black pour with a creamy brown head.  Aroma has the chili, cinammon, caramel, chocolate, roasted malt and some interesting fruit and wood notes.  Cant say its apples...more like golden raisins.  Flavor is just creamy, smooth and and rich as hell.  The spice of regular hunahpus is still evident, but a new rich flavor of apply-raisinss hits and some nice woody tones.  Jesus this was amazing.  Simply perfect."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 92)",3.9,Pours out black with brown head. Lots of spicey chocolate flavor.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 94)",5,"On tap at the Hunahpus release.

A: Pours black dark and evil, like all CCB Stouts. Very dark head, excellent retention and a crazy amount of lace.

S: Loads of barrel, woody, with a huge blast of brandy. The roast, earth, chocolate, and spice of the base Hunahpu’s remains as well. It is hard to describe.

T: Pure flavor explosion in your mouth. I really didn’t think you can improve on the base beer but they have. The brandy barrel just puts this one in another class. Huge brandy barrel without being over the top. Tons of charred malt, earthy chocolate, light chili’s and hints of vanilla. Rich chocolate, light molasses, and a dash of unicorn horn.

M: Very full in body, bold, rich, perfect.

D: Not really nor is it made to be. One I could sip on for days though."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,"(2, 95)",4.9,"Pours pitch black and completely opaque without even a trace of lighter color when held to a light source with a half finger dark chocolate mocha head that quickly fades into a thick lasting ring.

Amazingly complex aroma with a huge chocolate malt presence which is only slightly roasty with hints of toffee and caramel.  Sweet brandy alcohol heat that adds amazing complexity.  Subtle oak and vanilla blending in with the vinous dark fruit notes.

Chewy viscous body with lots of silky chocolate maltiness that is balanced out by the vinous apple brandy barrel notes.  Slightly earthy oak that is very vinous with hints of dark fruit and vanilla balancing out the chilli and roasted malt perfectly.  The spicy cinnamon chilli flavor is prominent in the dry finish.  Excellent!  I don’t see any way in which it could he improved with the exception of head retention."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"(1, 5)",3.7,"750mL bottled 2/26/21, drunk 11/21/22, thanks Chalameuax!
Undetermined clarity, dark mahogany with deep burgundy highlights in the light.  Medium-sized, tan head shows moderate retention.
Nose is beautiful and well-aged.  None of the unfermented sugars and syrupy fudge that so many stouts have these days.  The adjuncts are done incredibly tastefully, as well with none of it jumping out or dominating.  Dark chocolate, vanilla, moderate roast and ample sweet caramel from the malt with no alcohol, even after warming.  Everything melds together so well and it's shocking to me that this is a mere 21 months in bottle.  Drinks like it's homogenized for 5 years.
Soft, malty, rich and yet wonderfully attenuated.  Near-perfect balance giving appropriately chewy, luxurious textures with no syrupy sweetness or any fatiguing sugar on the finish.  Cinnamon spiciness helps balance and vanilla is soft and flavorful.  Nothing jumps out and this is a study in balance and finesse.  Through all that, it's still pleasingly rich and satisfying.  No alcohol whatsoever.  Pretty crazy that I never got on the Cigar City train - just missed the boat.  Glad to finally try this and I see now why Cigar City hit it big.   Hard to believe they've created this much depth, complexity and balance without barrel aging. This puts many barrel aged stouts to shame, which is impressive. 9/4/9/5/19
2018 bottle drunk 2023.
3 years older than the sublime 2021 bottle I had recently and just a mess of cinnamon and other overdone adjunct. Thin flavors and textures with unrefined sugariness. So bad that it got dumped immediately. Wow, what's with the consistency issues with this beer?? 8/4/5/3/9"

Taste is monumental with additional notes of anise, dark chocolate, vanilla, dark cherry, rum raisin, tobacco chew, leather and soft chili bite.  Thick mouthfeel.  Never overpowering.  As it warms, prune juice and tobacco flavors make a complex appearance.  Finish is long and complex and evolves like a story on the palette.  Each sip is slightly different and demands attention...  a conversation stopper.  Hunahpu's must be savored, not consumed quickly.  This beverage almost transcends the beer genre and is better described as more a kind of fermented elixir (as opposed to distilled spirits) than an imperial stout.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"(1, 39)",3.9,"Aroma: Bottle - The malts provide Dark rich chocolate aromas,  hints of toffee, and light notes of raisins.  There is a minor grassy note from the Hops. As i drink the asthma is a little alcohol. 

Appearance: Pitch black body, very opaque.  Ther head is dark brown, like melted chocolate.   Texture is tiny bubbles with a few medium around the edges.   The head lingers atop the beer but stays very thin. 

Flavor:  Dark roasted malts, a touch of smoke from the roasted malts, and a rich creamy malt sugar flavor from the malts.   A low hop taste and a nice bit of bittering hops.  Balance is malty and the finish is chocolate, roasted malts and bittering from the Hops. 

Mouthfeel: Body is full, with medium/ high carbonation.   There is a strong alcohol warmth,  and the malt base provides a solid creamy mouthfeel that overshadows the level of carbonation.   There is astringency due to the bittering hops but more from the roasted malts. 

Overall:  the beer is fairly well balanced and has a good Imperial Stout that is easy sipping beer a little bit of an alcohol hit."

Cinnamon is most noticeable, with a sort of odd earthy, musty aroma being pretty dominant as well. Perhaps a hint of coconut there. Taste is lots of chocolate and vanilla noticeable at first, with a decent bit of cinnamon and chili coming through as well. The chili really grows as you drink and the beer warms. Quite noticeable in the aftertaste in a really pleasant way. Hardly any boozyness there at all. Mouthfeel really is fantastic, very thick, sticky, almost oily and very smooth. This is really nice for a non-BA stout, but I have to say that I would still prefer SN Narwhal or Kernel's Imperial Brown Stout.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"(1, 72)",4.5,"Another one of the fabled, great imperial stouts that have spun their own mythology and everyone has to try at least once, or their beer nerd friends will think less of them. So, being a beer nerd with a fragile ego and some overly judgy friends, it was high time I tried this.


Not every beer in this category lives to the hype, but this certainly does. It gets every component just right. Even without the adjuncts, this would be a near-perfect stout. It's thick and full (although it holds back just enough not to be syrupy), and the flavors are a brilliant combination of chocolate, coffee, and a little bit of toasted/roasted grain. And then, on top of all of that, the adjuncts bring a smooth bit of vanilla, and some sweet and spicy heat, all of which compliments the base beer. Believe the hype!"
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"(1, 73)",3.8,"Mayan mythology, Hun Hunahpu was the father of the Mayan hero twins Hunahpu and Xbalanque. Hun Hunahpu, along with his brother Vucub Hunahpu, was tricked by the Dark Lords of the underworld and slain. Hun Hunahpu’s corpse morphed into a cacao tree, his head becoming a cacao pod, which in typically awesome mythology fashion, spit upon the hand of a young maiden named Xiquic who promptly became pregnant with the hero twins. The twins would ultimately grow up to avenge their father and uncle and defeat the Dark Lords and ascend the heavens to become the moon and sun. We brew Hunahpu’s Imperial Stout once a year and release it only at the brewery. We will continue to do so until the end of the cycle. Released on the second Saturday in March at the brewery."

Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, fudge, molasses, caramel, toffee, cinnamon, chili pepper, nuttiness, toasted dark bread, smoke, char, wood, light dark fruit, and herbal/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, cocoa, coffee, and spice flavors; with an awesome roasted bitter/sweet and pepper/cinnamon spice balance; with no acrid/astringent flavors after the finish. Slight dryness from roast/char bitterness and pepper/cinnamon spiciness, lightly increasing through the glass. Very minimal building pepper heat through the glass. Light-medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/rich, and slightly slick/sticky/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Alcohol is very well hidden; a very mild increasing warmth of 11.5% through the glass. Overall this is an insane spiced imperial stout! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, cocoa, coffee, and spice flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the big ABV. Damn near perfect balance of spice flavors, with insane levels of rich stout complexity. Great pepper presence with minimal added heat. A highly amazing offering. As a side note: the last tiny pour of the bottle was all yeast. There was an obscene level of dregs in the bottom, but the rest of the bottle was spot on."

Pours black with a half finger brown head. Taste brings chocolate, chille, roasted coffee, star anise, cinnamon, vanilla, roasted malts, chocolate syrup, slick black malts, green peppers, spices and black licorice upfront. Mid palate layers into multiple chocolate flavors, coffee grounds, toffee, lime juice, slight oak and alcohol sugars. Finishes semi sweet with cloves, cocoa nibs and more chilles. Moderately boozy yet, not overbearing in any way. Overall, well worth seeking out. Not like any beer I’ve ever had before. A+ rating."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"(2, 3)",4.1,"Barwa czarna, nieprzejrzysta. Piana gęsta, drobnopęcherzykowa, długoutrzymująca się. Aromat uderza cynamonem i wanilią - niezbyt intensywnie, ale jedank. Przede wszystkim prym wiodą intensywne słody palone, kakao, czekolada, czarna świeżo prażona kawa, trochę toffi, melasa. Piwo jest syropowate, gęste i ulepkowate. Trochę brązowego cukru. Nuty cynamonowe obecne są od początku - niezbyt intensywne, zrównoważone, raczej pozostają w tle, ale konsekwentnie są obecne do końca. Smak słodki, takie cynamonowe ciasteczko w płynie, momentami z elementami takiego organicznego miodu. Pod koniec wchodzi ostra papryczka, nie wiem sam czy urozmaica czy zaburza całokształt. Na pewno nie jest irytująca. Na pewno jest też pewnym urozmaiceniem i przełamuje tą słodycz piwa. Pijalność na imponująco i niebezpiecznie wysokim poziomie. Piwo doskonale zrównoważone. Coż można rzec na koniec - podstawa słodowa genialna, przyprawy wnoszą fajne ciasteczkowate nuty, przełamane nieco ostrą papryczką, która dla niektórych może być niepotrzebna, a dla innych zbawienna."

Flavour of rich dark chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, chili, nut butter, spice box, moderately heavy roast grain, cacao nibs, pepper heat building up to a moderate level in the finish, augmented by roast to dry out a somewhat sweet start. Quite full, oily, with soft carbonation and fairly subtle alcohol. Really nice stuff, not shy with the spices but achieves good balance and big concentration of flavours. Have to try this one again."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"(2, 12)",4.7,"Personally, still the best beer I have tried. It sort of trancends the word beer altogether and gives way to a culinary experience. You have to chew on this beer and appreciate the amazing balance of sweet, smokey,chocolate with nice subtle spice tones on the end. Spice , heat, sweet all come together into something that my words do not do justice. Better than the sum of its parts. A masterpiece worthy of praise. I would love to try something better- I’ve tried nothing close. Complexity incarnate."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"(2, 13)",4.4,"2016 Vintage thanks to drowland - Huge thanks, man! I freely admit that I am susceptible to hype, but I don’t think that’s the case here.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"(2, 14)",4.5,"Geproefd op Borefts 2016, het eerste bier van het festival, en een waar ik lang naar uit heb gekeken. Het werd uitgeschonken in het festival proefglaasje uit een wijn decanteerder, slechts een half glaasje vol, wat natuurlijk het exclusieve imago verhoogd. Dikke olieachtige body, met weinig schuim, een kleine lichtbruine schuimkraag die snel wegtrekt. Aroma’s van chocolade, kaneel, koekjes, vanille, kokos, specerijen, sojasaus, donker fruit. Het smaakpallet is zeer complex en met een vol en olieachtig mondgevoel. Tonen van pure chocolade, zachte koffie, kokos, kaneel, vanille en een subtiele peper notitie, een geweldig complex bier. Zachte carbonatie, en een lange afdronk van kokos en lichte kruidige tonen. Prachtig bier om het geweldige Borefts festival 2016 mee te beginnen! Toch werden de torenhoge verwachtingen niet geheel ingelost, er waren 2 Imperial Stouts op dit festival die ik proefde die beter waren (deze waren wel BA overigens) Toch ben ik hard op zoek naar een fles van Cigar City Hunahpu’s Imperial Stout voor een meer uitgebreidere beoordeling in aroma en smaak notities.

Very nice aroma, swwet, a glazed pastry with pistachios. Looks good. Dark, and a tight head. Tells me it’s going to be viscous. Not too heavy in the mouth, extremely full and smooth, a good consistency for a sipper. Chilli heat is obvious, but is kept remarkably mellow. Taste dominated by sugars, unsurprisigly, but is rather complex. Plenty pf piparkakku, and a nice chocolatiness to the roast. Very nice brew. Almost beer of the evening apart from the batch 028 Pohjala Oo that we pretty much started with, that had aged and become serious, this is young and still trying to stuff itself with candies, cookies, and chocolate. (It tied with a couple of other Pohjala Oo variants/vintages.)"

2013 vintage, on tap at MBCC 2018, red session. This is far below the Huna's I've had so far. Maybe it's the tap or the age or both. Still a good Imperial Stout, but it feels a bit rougher and a bit oxidized, with less lusciousness."

Flavor is very interesting with cacao and vanilla clearly present, and chillies giving slight burn in the throat. Very full-bodied and smooth with low carbonation.

Chocolate, flower petals, dried prunes, raisans, burnt wood, burnt paper, roasted peppers, vanilla, parfume, burnt matches, chocolate cake, coffee. Moderate sweet, steady bitter and mild spicey/peppery. Maximum bodied, smooth texture, good as no carbo but the pepper cleverly fills in with a prickliness on the tastebuds--who are my best buds, at this very moment. Oompf! Concentrated black mass.

Anchorage A Deal With The Devil - Double Oaked 2017,"(1, 30)",4.3,"2017 bottle drunk at the Referend First Anniversary line share, 12/2/17.
Deep mahogany-ruby, good clarity, with a dark beige head that shows moderate retention.
The nose shows rich oak tones that are not heavily toasted, or at least don't give the gross pina-colada character. Rather, spicy bourbon, rich wood and light rum raisin-like notes come through, with surprisingly soft esters, tons of cherry, vanilla, date, brown sugar and good acidity. Certainly some light alcohol, but it's not sharp, messy and it's pretty well-concealed for this abv. Extremely malty, yet it doesn't seem like it's going to be a sugary mess; the balance is definitely there. Furthermore, it's not chock full of specialty malt character, having a strong caramel-honey richness.
In the mouth it's ridiculously soft, creamy and malty, but shows good balance, as fruity, almost melanoidin-like acidity, strong wood and spicy liquor notes all balance the honey-caramel and brown sugar of the malts. The strong cherry-plum fruitiness is excellent and goes a long way to adding depth, while the barrel character adds an element as well, while not dominating the beer. Not syrupy in the least and doesn't feel underfermented. Warming alcohol dries the finish. Low but tight carbonation and no flaw. Damn, after having this masterpiece, I regret never trying any other ADWTDs...."
Anchorage A Deal With The Devil - Double Oaked 2017,"(1, 31)",4.7,"From notes. Enjoyed at the 5th Annual Barleywine Tasting at Travis and Nicole’s house on February 03. 375 mL bottle from the 2017 release. The pour is a nice dark brown color with a thick dap of lighter khaki head and a lack of lace as it falls down to nothing. The aroma is fantastic. There is a big time dark fruitiness up front with a sweet cognac and strong oak. A light vanilla and brown sugar come rolling in with a light bourbon on the back end. It almost finishes like a damn cookie. This thing is just awesome. The flavor is much of the same. The bit sweetness up front really draws you in, letting the caramel, toffee, and dark fruits take you over. The cognac and light oak balance out the alcohol before the bourbon and a light vanilla come in to round this thing off. Really freaking good. The mouth feel is thick and heavy bodied with a soft carbonation and a lingeringly alcohol present, dark fruit and caramel finish with a light charred oak on the back end.

Midnight Sun M,"(1, 2)",4.4,"No head, pouring viscously to deep dark purplish brown beer. Dark, partly roasted nuts, cognac, winebarrels, biscuit, immensely complex. Sweet raisins on brandy, boerejongens  , portwined, nuts (hazel-, wal-,..), and overripe banana, faint vanilla. Fusels and esters. Sugar beginning to caramelize. Sticky, full-bodied, despite its age (13 yrs), still very well-carbonated. Superbly aged, absolutely mindblowing brew."

Midnight Sun M,"(1, 5)",4.1,"650 mL bottle. Originally reviewed 5/18/2014.
Dark body. Nearly black. Small khaki head.

Nose is sherry and a bit of cardboard oxidation. Sweet brown sugar and caramel. Mild dark roasted malts.

Tastes sweet. Sherry flavored oxidation. Caramel. Some roasted malts. Dates. Not any barrel, really. Lots of raisin fruitiness.
Thick bodied. Sweet, but not overly so. Alcohol is still prevalent.

Well, I’m underwhelmed. It’s really good, but it’s not earth-shattering."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 6)",4.7,"650 ml bottle shared at the original Chez Moeder Lambic’s cellar. Hazy copper brown color with beige brown head. Malty aroma, caramel, chocolate, nutty, hazelnuts, vanilla, dark dried fruits, raisins, wood, alcohol. Sweet and light bitter taste like aroma. Medium to full oily silky body with soft carbonation. Great!"
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 7)",4.9,"Extreme & manifold thanks to kermis!!! 650 ml. bottle sampled. 2005 Vintage presumably. Nose carries clear oxidation over a sweet base of caramel syrup, toffee, thick malts & sugar. While unfavorable oxidation, thinned by age is clear in the nose, I found none in the taste which is extremely sublime. Taste is insane richness, thick toffee malts, sweet vanilla, almond, sweet walnut syrup, warming perfect sugar syrup, warming, soft carbonation, faint fruits leading into an almost chocolate-like finish. Really builds supreme complexity. I expected it to be past its point & just hype but this turned out to be amazingly supreme. Too bad that they don’t know how to remake it."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 8)",4.8,"@ A day to sink all seasheppards. Thnx for sharing, everyone !! Pours unclear, dark brown. No real head. Smell is intense, sweet, caramelized malts. taste is intense, dark malts, sweet, some vanilla, some bourbon, some oak. Very silky MF. Dark fruits, full-on intensity ! sticky aftertaste. Low ( perfect) carbo. The beers keeps evolving during drinking, and Always make you crave for more. insane how good this has held up. The best one of the mega-tasting, so it seems !!!"
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 9)",4.8,"Bottle shared at A Day To Sink All Sea Shepards tasting.  Fairly clear dark reddish brown with a ring tan head. Aroma of big caramel, toffee, floral notes coming out, rich malt, fruity notes developing, butterscotch, vinous notes and raisins. Flavour is heavy sweet. Full bodied with soft carbonation. Beautiful stuff, so complex building and developing with each sip.  Superb and lives up to the hype."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 10)",4.5,"Bottle. Brown pour with tan head. Sweet dark fruit, spice, chocolate, candy and caramel aromas. Tootsie roll perhaps, chocolate, roasted, candy, caramel, vanilla and a bunch of sweetness."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 11)",4.5,"Bottle. Pours dark brown tan head. Nose and taste of bourbon, molasses, caramel, oak, tobacco and port - medium body. Smooth."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 12)",4.1,"Thanks to Hallinghansen for the bottle. Much, much appreciated. 

Dark brown color, light tan head that falls away quickly to a thin layer. Thick ABV legs on the sides of the glass. 
Nose starts off oxidized but falls off to prunes, cherries, figs, brown sugar, red grape and Belgian chocolate. After the oxidation this nose is top notch. No hints of bourbon or oak though. 
Taste is very complex. Belgian chocolate, red grape, red cherries, figs, plumbs, brown sugar, and red wine. Very vinous. At the end it did get bourbon, coconut and vanilla.
Long lasting in the palate. Sweet and sticky. Big mouth on this. The long lasting feel is what set this apart from anything else I have had. 
Has it dropped off?? Probably but still world class in a massive way. Few fresh ones can come close to this. Worth what gave up to get this. Only a couple of none BA versions come close to this beer. Must have been a beast a few years ago."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 13)",4.4,"4200th rating! Thanks to cheapbeerbuzz for trading this one
 I feel that drinking this on the same night as completing the top 50. This marks an end to a very long fun journey to seek the best and drink the best. I will still continue to tick, but try to focus my efforts more towards local quality and sharing with friends, rather than saving and trading for the next best thing. Anyways, on to the rating. Poured an intimidating very dark brown to black with a miniscule beige head. Aroma was Bourbon soaked dark fruits, digs, prunes, caramel, toffee and light oxidation
 Flavor was incredibly balanced, figs, berries light roast, vbourbon, toasted caramel, light vanilla, and only mild booze. Incredible how this has held up after 9 years. I really wish I could have tried this new. Glad to have shared this with Artmcd8, Lithy, Charule, and hornydevil, and hope to share many more in the future. Cheers!"
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 14)",4.2,"Bottle split with beerman6686 in a trade. Thanks for setting this trade up, Dan. Glad I could have my close beer friends in attendance to share this beer. I feel like there should be a cool story associated with searching for this beer but there isn’t. It sorta just fell in my lap and I couldn’t pass up the opportunity. The beer is 9 years old at this point but the bottle looked brand new. It pours a thick dark brown, nearly black without a head. Some bubbles rise to the surface. The aroma is of oxidation, must, caramel, butterscotch, dust, slight chocolate, dark fruits like candied raisins. The taste is sweet, tastes like liquid caramel and raisins. It is almost like a lighter JW Lee’s. The beer was definitely built to last for awhile. The mouthfeel is medium thick even with the lack of much carbonation. It was a wonderful way to kick off a great night of drinking with friends."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 15)",4.1,Bottle super thanks to Beerman. Poured blackish with no head. No carb med bod. Aroma of alcohol soaked raisins. Prune booze taste with some barrel. Excellent
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 16)",4.7,"Bottle - pours dark, thick black w/ some viscosity. Wine, grapes, caramel, oak and dark fruit aroma. The flavor is very rich and smooth. Dark fruit, winey, malty and damn good!!!"
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 17)",4.3,"65cl, retired exclusive American brew, thx alot to Antonio for shipping this over!, very complex brew, malty/sweet and slightly fruity/alcoholic, yet not too heavy, very balanced, cloudy, small head, world class!, yet very expensive!, ’To celebrate my 5000th beer rating; this awesome sample aged very well! Wondering how this would have tasted a few years ago...’"
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 18)",5,"One of the most special bottles I have had the honour to taste. Thanks to Jeffo! I am quite critical when it comes to hypes, but this one lives up to it, and beyond... With some background in wine tasting, the M is one of the few beers where all of the individual aroma and taste components have beautifully merged into a ""bouquet""’, just like wine. One of the richest aromas ever experienced in beer: a perfect fruitiness (raisins, lots of raisins, figs, dates, dark prunes, plums and Belgian syrup aka ""poepspijs"") balanced in the most perfect way with sourness and sweetness. This is so much more than a beer... this is nothing less than divine."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 19)",4.6,"Been after this one for years! Thanks to Mac for helping me land this beast.  Pours nearly pitch black with handsome tan head & lace. Liquified Belgian candi sugar dominates the aroma. Some roastyness and bourbon, oak, hints of smoke too. Smells pretty nice, but the taste is where this baby shines.  Torrents of flavor pummel my taste buds, imparting liquified candi sugar, sticky caramel, mild licorice, miles of complexity. Boozy warmth at the end doesn’t bite like others do. Low carb = fantastic.  Jesus this is good. One of the very best liquids I’ve ever consumed."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 20)",4.1,"Wonderful moment with two great friends, cheers to Kevin and Jeremy. Pour is black with light brown head. Nose is salty, soy, and date. A fair amount of berry fruit sweetness behind. Taste is a bit less soy, sweet berry, dates and figs. Some caky rum soaked raisin or date. Really soft body, full an gentle at the same time with very soft carbonation and extremely inviting. Overall, not really any oxidation, a really well put together beer, lots of sweetness but not sugary, nothing mind blowing but very solid."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 21)",3.8,"Planned this review a week in advance. Expected an analytical comparison with added details on each of the 10+ barleywines we picked as background. But it hissed upon opening, we smiled, and then drank up.

M is achievement, a moment, the end of a long search in a hobby of ""what’s next?"" Our bottle celebrated friendship, years of joint efforts, trips, tastings, and thousands of miles. Today it was a 6hr project to buy, transport, build, and then use a ping pong table long into the night. M is still really good just no longer great. But that’s not why you go after it.
 Thank you Chris. 
Thank you Jeremy."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 22)",4.2,"A much sought after bottle for me. Pours deep brown, near black, with a wispy ring around the edges. Nose is dates, light soy, kind of mild but pleasant, meatier than expected. Mouth is very refined, old tasting. A lot of rum soaked dates, sweet rum cake. Sweet and full of dates and cake along the finish. Some smoke, coconut sugars open up. Feel is thick, full, silky. Elegant, regal, very nice. Quite sweet, cake like, marshmallow sweets. I would have loved to have enjoyed this 5 years ago but I won’t sully this moment with those thoughts."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 23)",3.9,"Bottle at Tony/Jim BA Birthday Extravaganza 2013 (Western Springs, IL). Fucking Sean. Pours a deep roasty brownish hue, dark with a good hazy body. Gentle copper brown glow on the edges. Frothy offwhite layer atop laces small, mellow lacing. Aromas are a bit oxidized, mellow oak, toffee and caramel. Gentle dryness, earth, and toast. Some gentle biscuit, toast. Initial is a bit thicker, firm body with mellow oxidation. Touches of caramel, toast and toffee. A bit thinner, more approachable, mellow warm$$th. Some gentle toast, vanilla and biscuit. A bit oxidized, touch of cardboard and age. Middle is a touch sticky, carmelized, mellow oak and gentle warmth. Finish is a touch sticky, some vanilla, oak and biscuit. Mellow toasty. A bit past it’s prime but a pleasure to try. Some toastiness, biscuit, and oak sticks on to the backend. Still rocking it without much body or sticky sweetness. A touch faded on the nose but still nice. Nice stuff, even for it’s age."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 24)",4.5,"Mmmmmmmmm. Smell is fantastic. Not quite like any other beer I’ve had. Smells of caramel covered dates. Taste is exceptional. Hybrid of barleywine and stout - lots of dark fruit, rich depth of character. Lightly sweet and incredibly smooth. Looks like a blend of barleywine and stout - lightly carbed."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 25)",4.2,"Second to last bottle I have left. Fantastic Barley Wine from Midnight Sun. Unbelievably smooth for a Bourbon barrel aged ale. I’ve had this beer 3 times and it appears to age well with the tobacco and burnt sugar notes significantly increasing with age. The funny thing about this beer was I obtained a number of bottles (8) for around $40. total and recently sold a single bottle for $4500.00. The beer is good but not worth that price. During this review, I did  a cross comparison with a 1953 Truman’s No. 1 Barley Wine Coronation Year. Suprisingly, I found the 1953 Truman’s better than the Midnight Sun M."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 26)",4.1,"Can finally say that it isn’t as oxidized as expected. A bottle that jus recently came out of alaska so maybe the lower ambient temps helped it out. It is a great barleywine, caramel, bourbon, sweet but well-aged."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 27)",4.8,"Bottle courtesy of AKFaust and BrewBoone. Colour...deep mahogany brown with  no head. Nose...smells just like Don Pedro Ximenez but with crushed dates, Brooks prunes and dark fruit cake. Palate...delicately carbonated with an immediate rush of Christmas cake and fruit bar. Next comes the waves of dark raisins, medjool dates and dark currants followed by a slightly bitter burnt brown sugar hit and a plush yet semi-tannic mouthfeel that adds an interesting  dimension to the experience. This is a truly unique and rare beer!"
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 28)",4.2,"Very, very dark brown pour, almost black, with a khaki head. Rich bourbon and vanilla notes, lots of dark fruits, a hint of leather, and plenty of wood. Some sweet caramel, a mild to moderate oxidation, and a fair amount of chocolate. Sweet brown sugar and caramel notes which go nicely with the fruit, bourbon, and vanilla. Mild chocolate, some oxidation, molasses, and a hint of alcohol."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 29)",4.4,"I want to start off by saying thank you to the generous BA who shared this with a few of us last night.  I definitely thought trying this one was beyond my reach.  ""We are but mere mortals in the presence of M.""  Indeed.

Pours extremely dark for a barleywine, dark mahogany brown, with a small beige head.  It looks almost like a Belgian dark in color, almost black.

Aroma is outstanding and has clearly held up to the years in the bottle.  It’s a good bit fruiter than I was expecting, certainly more than the typical barleywine.  Lots of raisins and plums mixed with chocolate and caramel.  The oak is present with some light tannins, leather and booze.

The taste just doesn’t live up to the aroma though it’s still extremely good.  This is clearly where the age is beginning to catch up to M, with hints of oxidation creeping in.  The booze soaked dark fruits are in the forefront, but with a chocolate-covered character to the whole thing.  The finish is a mixture of port, oak and the oxidized notes.

The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, and softly carbonated.  Hides the alcohol exceptionally well
.
This is one of the more complex barleywines I’ve ever had and the nose really stands up to anything I’ve ever smelled in the style.  I have to imagine that this would have been one of the best beers I’ve ever tasted if I had it 2-3 years ago.  As it is, I feel lucky to have been able to try it and it has held up much better than could be expected."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 30)",4.3,"Wow...bottle shared by scraff. Thanks a lot, Scott!

The beer appears a dark, chestnut brown color and displays a small, oily, beige head. Only sparse lacing is left behind as well as an oily, filmy layer that coats the snifter.

The aroma shows a bit of age and a myriad of scents, to include figs, raisins, plums, oak, booze, maple, brandy, toffee, caramels.

The beer is rich and luxurious, yet light on the palate somehow. Smooth and velvety, a silky feel. The flavor resembles a fine tawny port or sherry. Dark fruits coated with brown sugar. A delicate sweetness is present throughout. A light, warming booze presence, but unobtrusive. This beer goes down effortlessly. What an experience."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 31)",4.7,"Thanks Mike for bringing this epic bottle. Another bottle I never thought I’d have the honor of trying, thank the lord for Epic Tres! Pours a dark brown with some reddish hues when held to the light. Good carbonation on the pour. Nose opens up with honey and caramel, then moves onto more caramel, dark fruit, light booziness, cocoa, and oak. Tastes slightly oxidized, but it’s still a phenomenal barleywine. Caramel, honey, chocolate, malt, dark fruit, some light brown sugar, and molasses. Exceptionally smooth, not really boozy at all, low carbonation, and a long finish. Not just a product of hype, M is a real damn good beer. While it may be slightly past it’s peak, it is still one of the best barleywines I’ve ever had. Thanks again Mike."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 32)",4.2,"Huge, huge thanks to Scott for opening this bottle and giving me the opportunity to try some.  Served in a Midnight Sun goblet.  Pours a very dark brown with a thin light tan head that recedes fairly-quickly, leaving behind a few spots of lacing as it falls to a thin collar.  The nose has loads of dark fruits with plum and raisin being prominent.  The background is a bit of caramel and toffee with very mild esters.  Some barrel character is there, though it’s in the background.  The flavor adds in a touch of port character along with a very mild oak and vanilla presence.  Not the most complex that I’ve had, but quite good.  Body is medium with low carbonation and a slight viscosity.  Smooth with no noticeable alcohol.  Overall, a very delicious beer that I would have at any time.  However, at this point, I’d say that things like King Henry and perhaps Kuhnhenn BB4D are equal or better.  Still, what a damn fine experience."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 33)",4.3,"Dark brown in color, clear with a thin head.  Nice dried fruit aroma with alight Belgian yeast lingering.  The flavor was fruity and sticky sweet.  I get a dried prune and slight citrus flavors.  Very sweet bourbon aromas and flavors linger this brew also is high in alcohol and you can taste it.  A terrific brew after all these years.  Thanks Midnight Sun for the taste."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 34)",4.4,"A: Dark chocolate brown body with a thin to moderate sized khaki head. Light amount of lacing left behind.

S: Tootsie rolls, brownies, slight burnt brown sugar, the slightest hints of sherry and booze.

T: Chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, sherry, toffee, slight booze, oak, and a hint of vanilla.

M: The highlight of the beer. Sublimely smooth with a light to medium level of carbonation. Decadent, silky-sweet finish. Not cloying in the slightest. Perfect.

O: This is close to a 19/20 here, but the nose could have been a ""tad"" better. Well worth the hunt... I am lucky I didn’t have to do the hunting. The hype is well deserved and this is (still) drinking great.  Thanks, Joe."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 35)",4.8,"This was presented as a surprise bottle by Jon at a tasting. tried to go into this as imparital as possible. poured about 3-4 oz into a large stemed goblet. color is dark brown with a small dense head that falls quickly. clear up to the light. smell is rich dark malts mixed with dark fruits belgian yeast esters and rich barrel oak and bourbon component. notes of dark sugars and tobacco. there is a moderate note of oxidation that almost ties all the smells together. taste is, well, a barrel aged belgian barelywine. perfectly executed. a rich malt base with notes of brown sugar carmel maple syrup leads to a touch of dark fruits rasin and light note of roasty chocolate and a bit of tobacco. belgian yeast esters a touch fruity but clean and kept in check. barrel component adds a vanilla oaky char with a hint of spirit. finish is a touch sweet with a light bitter balance. a touch of alcohol to taste. oxidation is definitely noted but mild and adds another note of complexity. mouthfeel is super smooth and full bodied without much alcohol to feel. carbonation is low lending a creaminess to the feel. the balance of all the components sets this one apart from all the others. I can’t thank Jon enough for sharing this masterpiece"

A - Pours a very dark brown, almost black, small ring around the glass, no head or lacking to speak of. 

S - Huge sweetness, caramel, molasses, slight dark fruit, ultra-smooth alcohol. Just an excellent combo of sweetness and booze. Lots of chocolate in there as well...wow. The oak is a perfect touch. 

T - Burnt sugars, caramels, chocolate, touch of oak, dark fruits. This is like a decadent chocolate truffle mixed with sweet caramel and dark fruit. Seriously amazing. Lots going on...just excellent.

Bottle courtesy of tpd975. Thanks for the amazing share, Greg! Pours dark caramel brown with an off-white head. Nose is what I imagine northern purgatory smells like: malt, caramel, some sugar, brandy, plums, brown sugar, raisin, chocolate, toffee, and heath bar.  Flavor is similar, but it would be wrong not to name it out: brown sugar, malt, caramel, toffee, brandy, raisins, dark fruit, and a barely noticeable hop presence.

Muddy brown with virtually no head, just very still and quite hypnotic to look at. Wonderful aroma, huge and bold, molasses, raisins a touch of vanilla and a little bit of bourbon, quite spectacular, I spent a good 10 minutes just breathing in this rare creation. Sweet is the first thing that hits my lips, a little more bourbon, slightly fruity and more dark molasses, but not what I expected after smelling it for all that time, but this was just plain fucking tasty and I look forward to the time when/if I get a chance to try it again.

A:  Pours a nice deep shade of brown with tinges of angry maroon showing through.  The head is rather small with little retention or lace.

S:  Wonderful malty sweetness.  Tons of sweet molasses, chocolate, caramel, and over ripe dark fruit.

T:  This one has gloriously aged.  Tons of wonderful malt sweetness.  Molasses, caramel, and rich nutty toffee.  Dark fruit is there with mild chocolate, mild woody notes and a dash of vanilla.

M:  On the fuller side of body, rich, bold, smooth, sweet, tasty, with a bit of booze in the finish

Nose is dark fruit and chocolate up front, later notes of caramel, molasses, and smoke become more apparent.  As it warmed I started getting some wood notes in the nose.  Full bodied with soft carbonation and a slightly syrupy, creamy mouth feel.  The flavor is sweet malt with loads of dark fruit like cherries, fig, and raisin.  Flavor also contained big notes of caramel, chocolate, brown sugar, wood, and vanilla.  Finishes very sweet almost to the point of being cloying, alcohol is very well hidden.  Major thanks to Greg for sharing this gem."

Pours a striking mahogany with thin tan head. The aroma is caramel covered graham cracker and black strap molasses as well as musty aged figs, dates and plums. It smells of smooth yum and is very inviting. The taste is smooth rich creamy goodness with aged minced raisins fully populating a thick slice of pumpernickel and then moving into sweet black strap molasses, creamy caramel and then rich smooth blended notes of prunes, figs and dates. It evens out into the finish a bit with soft notes of chocolate and burnt molasses. This tastes fantastic and doesn’t overwhelm with syrupiness by ending with a high degree of drinkabilty. In fact, I can see myself drinking a little of this every night."

Aroma is heavy malt (caramel, toffee, nutty), light hop (herbs), average yeast (leather) with notes of raisin, date, port, and brown sugar.  Full bodied, creamy texture, average carbonation, and an astringent finish.  Long duration, heavy sweetness, light acidity and bitterness."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 54)",4.8,"Consumed August 29, 2009. To date this has to be the most amazing beer I have ever had. The hype surrounding this beer is not what even made it, the beer is actually ridiculously good and so original and complex. Dark rich brown color with no head. Pours so thick and rich and just looks smooth. Aroma has chocolate, cream, molasses, cake and some rich dark candied fruit. Flavor is really complex. Rich dark chocolate and sundae syrup. Some alcohol warms you right up but isn’t overpowering at all. Some fruit jam and lots of sweetness finish this off. Awesome!"
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 55)",4.9,"I want to start out with a huge thank you to hoppymeal for trading his only other bottle of M!  

Looks black or very dark brown from a distance, but when held to light has some very dark red colors to it.  Excellent clarity on the beer.  The head is tan colored and hangs around well leaving a decent lacing.  Aroma jumps out of the glass with burnt sugar, molasses, sour cherries, mint, rum, bourbon, oak, plum, raisins, and Christmas cookies.  Intense and complex smell, but everything smells so delicious.  Taste is full of brown sugar, molasses, huge amount of caramel, cherries, bourbon, and vanilla.  Mouthfeel is full, but so damn smooth, not cloying at all.  Low carbonation and full body cause this to slide over the tongue delivering deliciousness to every taste bud possible.  A beautiful beer to drink, I could sip on this beer all day, but sadly I don’t ever think I’ll see a bottle again.

As much as I had built this beer up in my mind after finding out everything I could about it, I didn’t think it would be able to live up to what I believed it to be.  Somehow, M knew my expectations and instead of breaking under the pressure, it stood strongly and proudly saying take it or leave it.  Take it, I will.  Simply M-mazing!"
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 56)",4.3,"Huge thanks to hoppymeal, pepsican, badbeer, and iowaherkeye.Low carbonation. Really smooth finish. Lots of fruit. Moderately sweet. fig & currant. Nice caramel, chocolate, slight butterscotch. Plums. Finishes with lots of chocolate & caramel. Some burnt sugar."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 57)",4.2,"Pours a reddish brown with a nice sized tan head.  Aroma has a nice bit of chocolate, raisin, cherry, plums, old pears.  Flavor was up front chocolate and caramel.  Lots of sweet fruits are also dominate,  mainly plums and cherries.  It definitely has a light amount of sherry and cardboard oxidation that isn’t quite distracting yet,  but I could see it getting in the way soon.  A bit of bourbon, vanilla, bubblegum, and toffee round this one out.  The mouthfeel and finish are damn near perfect.  I always want to hate aged beer,  but I can’t with this.  Awesome."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 58)",4.4,"Pour was very dark brown with a small tan head.  The aroma was sugary chocolate, vanilla and oak.  The body was medium to thick with low carbonation, which fit well.  The taste was plenty of sweet chocolate with hints of port and raisins.  Really good stuff."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 59)",3.9,"Bottle cracked open to celebrate my 35th birthday.  Pours dark brown with some off white bubbles around the rim of the snifter.  Smells dry and oaky with some dark fruit, pepper, earthy, cognac, some molasses.  Tastes of sweet malt, some vinous hints, toffee, some nuttyness, dry.  Well balanced and enjoyable."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 60)",4.6,"22oz bottle, special thanks to Tim at a BA cellar party. I thought I had missed this one and would never get the chance to try it but happened to be in the right place at the right time with some of the coolest people on the planet. Poured into a tulip at cellar temp, about 4 years old at the time of tasting. Deep brown with a tiny head that swirled around the glass like the milky way galaxy. Aroma was very complex, oak, bourbon, prunes, toffee, caramel. The taste was mostly sweet but was cut perfectly by the wood and alcohol flavors. Not syrupy like I imagined it but silky smooth with mild carbonation, age may be thinning this out to perfection. From the others in the room that have had this before, sounds like it just keeps getting better and still hasn’t peaked. Maybe, if I’m lucky the beer gods will rain down blessings of “M” again in the future. Some beers rate high because of their limited availability and lore but this is not one of them, to date the best beer I’ve ever had."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 61)",4.5,"From my backlog dated September 6th:
22oz bomber shared by an extremely generous individual. 



Dark nearly opaque pour with hardly a drop of head.  Nearly devoid of carbonation.  Ominous.  Aromas of oloroso sherry with bits of vanilla.  Deep and absorbing.  Bizarre flavour.  Triple, barley wine and light bourbon barrel stout all rolled into one.  Wow.  Finally, someone who managed to pull off integrating various attributes of very different styles of beer.  Not only succeeded, but really excelled.  Deep vinous character that morphed into various layers of complexity.  Very nice mouthfeel that just enhanced the experience.  Some additional sherry notes on the end that give away its age.  Just such a unique beer with very separate and unique components that somehow manage to balance and compliment each other wonderfully.  



Many thanks Jason for sharing such an elusive beer."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 62)",4.6,"Thanks to Moejuck for sharing this outstanding brew!  22oz bomber pours a dark brown, opaque, with slight ruby hue in the glass.  It has a very port-like nose of dark fruit, vanilla, bourbon, oak gooey malts you can almost taste through your nose.  The mouth feel is smooth as silk with very light carbonation.  The taste is rich and buttery with molasses, a long sweet finish loaded with dark fruit and bourbon; gotta love this taste.  This brew is still very drinkable with the alcohol in the stealth mode; an outstanding finish, kind of like drinking a glass of port wine.  Would love to have this superb brew again some day."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 63)",4.5,"Bottled, thanks to someone quite generous!  Rating #3,000! 

 Poured damn near black with a viscous body that absorbed any semblance of head.. still and alluring.  The aroma was deep and engaging, showcasing bourbon and vinous port characteristics.. treacle, vanilla, and candi sugar on the 2nd impression.. sweeter chocolates and brown sugar deeper yet.. perfectly integrated!  The flavor opened with syrupy molasses, vinous notes, and bourbon backed by sweeter chocolates and candi sugar.. bourbon presence increased toward the back with vanilla, toasted oak, and peppery warmth.. finished with tobacco, lightly sour bourbon, and dry-roasted chocolates.  Heavier-bodied with low carbonation on the palate.. rather syrupy feel overall.. sourness worked well.. near-perfect balance.  Great one!!"
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 64)",4.6,"Generously brought to one of our hotel room tastings, GABF 2007.  Thanks to whoever did bring it, because it was one of the best beers I had at the fest (I think it might have been cquiroga, as usual bestowing dopeness on the collected beer geeks in his vicinity).  Big sudsy taupe head.  Smells like buttery vanilla with oakey oily bourbon a well-proportioned accent.  Wonderful mouthfeel: silky, full, and smooth.  Flavors are so full; DOPE: rich, melted Belgian chocolate is the main thing, fruity bourbon blending perfectly with the rich thick maltiness of chocolate, porty plums, and toffee.  Really, this is one of the best uses of bourbon as an accent rather than a mainline that I have ever experienced.  All the goodness persists in a clean, malty finish.  Wow.  Blessed be the dopeness that is M.  I hope I get another sip during my lifetime."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 65)",4.4,"Bottle, Cleveland tasting, Moejuck!   Pours ruby/brown color with a thin tan colored head.   Aroma is molasses, brown sugar, caramel malts.   Flavor is again molasses, brown sugar, caramel, raisins, hint of alcohol.   Palate is full bodied, mild to almost no carbonation, finished chewy and sticky sweet.   Wonderful brew, leaves a sticky coating on the lips."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 66)",4.7,"Dark brown, white-cream colored very thin head. sweet molasses aroma with alcohol bite.  Flavors of caramel and vanilla, very smooth and sweet."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 67)",4.4,"bottle at Carolina Crew get together, from the hand trade with timmcd64 & juzy while on my Alaskan BW fest trip. Great aroma, so much going on with this, wow, Smoke, chocolate, brown sugar, raisin. Clean brownish black color, small head & lacing. Bitter sweet flavor, Like I said with the aroma and a vanilla bourbon addition. Thick body, creamy mouthfeel, bitter sweet finish. This was a great brew, aged wonderfully. Aroma, flavor this had it all. Incredible balance of things. My words aren’t doing this justice."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 68)",4.4,"22oz bottle, courtesy of Stine.  Thanks, Eben!  Pours a very dark, cola-brown color; light tan head with patchy lacing; touch of oiliness.  Caramel, dates, and raisins in the aroma; plenty of dried fruits, with a very relaxed bourbon aroma underneath: slight, sticky bourbon and buttery vanilla (very much in the background); impressively balanced.  Relaxed carbonation. Medium-to-full mouthfeel: chewy caramel, dried dark fruits (dates, raisins), and nougat; exceptionally balanced and drinkable; velvety mouthfeel: beautifully integrated bourbon notes (toasty rounded liquor, vanilla, soft wooden notes) with a chewy caramel and dried fruits; I wasn’t completely submerged by the first sip, but there’s so much here when allowed to open up, and so integrated; remarkably drinkable and soft.  Excellent.  Lengthy finish: chewy dried fruits, dates, and sweet vanilla / toasty malts; very soft ending."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 69)",4.5,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle.  Rich chocolate brown, oak hued pour producing a brimming crown of tan that gathers in a ring around the edge.  Sweet, refined aroma of bourbon, caramel and candi sugar, citrus, port wine, oak, and raisin.  Smooth, glimmering polish and never a moment of overindulgence or reckless decadence; most notable is the cleanness and calmness of it.  Raspberries and pomegranate lend a bit of zingy tartness along an alcohol hit back end.  Spirit touched throughout, but more as a silky ribbon of bourbon presence than a sudden iron fisted punch. 


Flavor is monstrously rich and juicy; streamlined balance.  Dates, red licorice, prunes, belgian chocolate, mousse, caramel.  Lush, sensual, contemplative complexity that seems so soft and silky.  It isn’t a monstrous, confronting sweetness but more a clean, rich cavendish tobacco, rustic campfire dessert sweetness.  Full, delicate oak and bourbon tanginess and fleshy, rich red fruits sitting in a wet oatmeal cookie dough.  Sugar everywhere and all with a polished dark edge.



Brilliantly reserved full palate.  Balanced, syrupy body is firm but never imposing; it seems to taper off into a reticent tannic feel briefly, rather than diving headlong into the ostentatious decadence it seems bound toward, before settling on a calm, creamy maple  texture.  The restraint and balanced execution at that point are nothing short of stunning.  Pungent date flavor finishes.



Having sunk slowly into a soil of rich character and otherworldly sweetness, the potential for this example still seems excitingly bottomless, although this gorgeous point of settled complexity could probably be considered somewhere within its peak.  Thanks Tim!"
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 70)",4.3,"Courtesy of Mr. Kotter himself, Stine. Dark brown/black body with medium sized tan head. There’s a lot of nutty bourbon in the nose, but it’s very soft and not the least bit aggressive. Along with the bourbon is some nice dark fruit and toffee character as well as light molasses and a touch of alcohol. Flavor is sweet, but not overbearing, lots of prunes and toffee, some bourbon and caramelized raisins. Very port-like. Full bodied, extremely soft texture with light carbonation. Long, sugary finish with a touch of bitterness. I usually don’t go for sweet beers, but this one works. Thanks Eben."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 71)",4.3,"Huge thanks to oldgrowth for sharing this at the Carolina Gathering. Pours a dark brown with a thin brown head, looks great. The nose is sweet, earthy, caramel, citrusy, very nice nose, not too much alcohol. The flavor is very nice, sweet, molasses and some brown sugar, plum, fruity, nice malt, soothing warmth. Nice full mouthfeel with a slight warmth finishes sweet and earhty."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 72)",4.8,"Holy shit.  I can’t believe Tom brought this to the gathering.  Pours dark brown with a small bubbled head.  Nose is rich with brown sugar, caramel, belgian yeast, spices, toffee.  Its sweet, without being the least bit cloying. Its rich, oaky and vinous, without being too tannic. Mouthfeel is full, silky and smooth.  This is easily the most drinkable barleywines I have ever had.  And one of the best beers too.  Chewy and smooth.  Now I know why so many people want this beer.  Thanks so much for sharing Tom!!"
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 73)",4.6,"Huge, huge thanks to Oldgrowth for cracking open this amazing wonder of a beer at the Carolina crew gathering at Turd’s place. Now three years old, this is probably at it’s peak and it rockets right to my top spot overall. I just can’t deny it its proper scores, and it was a pure delight to drink it. The aroma is just heavenly, wafting out from the dark, but evidently crisp body with heavy notes of malts and nuts initially and a slight fruit tang that promises complexity. But man, once it warmed up it went to another level. Vinous without being overpowering, and toffee notes that suggest an English barleywine or old ale but with a multi-leveled texture that comes courtesy of some bright fruits, hops, and the aforementioned wine qualities. Very full and silky mouthfeel, with tobacco and molasses emerging strongly, ending up like a top-notch port. So many different qualities in a beer that goes to so many different places, all while retaining a singular and unique identity of its own. Amazing. Thanks, Tom!!!"
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 74)",4.3,"Very sweet.  Thick and chewy, pours a very dark color.  Well masked abv.  Nice flavors of oak, vanilla, caramel, and mild bourbon.  Pretty nice."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 75)",4.7,"Thanks to BrianK for sharing this on the 3 year anniversary of its release, 5/5/08.  Bottle.  Pours dark ruby brown.  Little to no head.  Aromatic character is dark fruit plum, fig, chocolate, candy sugar.  Mouthfeel is smooth and thick. sweet plumy, chocolate, and refreshing from etoh.  Chewy, very chewy mouth coating leaves you wanting more quickly.  Wow tobacco, bourbon in the finish, i want more again.  WOW!"
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 76)",4.4,"A long time coming for this guy.  A highlight of the 4/12 tasting at J’s pad - go figure, our numbers line up.  Big shout out to Tim - thanks man for making this happen. 

Poured quite dark w/ minimal head dissipating into tiny bubbles.  Nose was hovering around sweet malts, raisins, candi sugar, and deeply bourbon soaked wood.  Subtle but arrogant.  Flavor was damn sweet up front with a heavy dose or raisin, sugars, prunes, berries, toffee, wood, tobacco, brown sugar, smoky burnt malt behind the upfront sweetness - rounded by a port like elegance.  The palate and body on this beer is a slice of heaven...rich, smooth, cocky, mellow, and pissed off all at once.  It is evident the years of aging have melded, mellowed, and blended these flavors into a mouth coating blanket like palate - the body of this beer are in a dream like state.  The belgian yeast strains also shine in the background - you can feel their influence in how the body and flavors differ from a cut throat, balls deep american style b-wine.  The bourbon presence plays a mentor type role here - rather than a smothering and flavor raping son of a bitch - I dig that here.  This is and was a work of art....I can only wonder how it will continue to develop - as for now, it sure is drinking greatly."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 77)",4.4,"A major thanks to jarspag for cracking open this huge rarity; I never thought we would ever get to try this when I first heard of it months and months ago. Very very dark for a barley wine, nearly black in the center with lighter maroon edges. Fading beige head and spotty lacing. Smells delicious! Sweet, caramelized Belgian candy sugar with raisin and plum, oak wood and loads of toffee. Some earthy leather tones and bourbon fruitcake underneath. Intriguing Belgian influence in the flavor, fruity and sweet. The candy sugar comes out more in the flavor with notes of port wine, black grape and raisin cinnamon bread. The +/-3 years of age show nicely, as the flavors are very mellowed and well-blended. A hint of stingy oxidation is noticeable. Extremely smooth palate with a lasting flavor of sugary bourbon and oak. Overall the bourbon barrel is more subtle than expected, and the Belgian yeast strains give it a unique and complex aspect. Excellent!"
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 78)",4.1,"22oz bottle poured into a sinfter shoved into my face by Kan less than a minute after I entered the door. ""Here drink this. It’s fuc*in’ sweet!"" he says. OK... sure. Very malty aroma. Boatloads of vanilla, toffee, chocolate. Quite rich. Pours a near opaque brown with no sign of a head. The flavor is absolutely decadent. Thick chocolate, toffee, caramel, vanilla, brown sugar. Damn... Absolutely chewy body. Thick, viscous and creamy. Heavenly. Thanks a ton Kan!"
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 79)",4.2,"Wow, I am forever grateful to pantanap for opening this gorgeous beer.  Pours black with a tan head.  Aroma is strong with toffee, caramel, red fruit and slight vegetal malts.  With the oxidized vegetal notes this may be just past its peak, but not too far.  Rich flavors of toffee, chocolate, raisins, and red fruit.  As this warms the chocolate notes ebb while the dark fruits grow.  Creamy smooth and so incredibly drinkable.  I could sit with this one glass for hours.  Delicious."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 80)",4.3,"Rating #1400!! 22oz bottle. I can’t thank pantanap enough for sharing this amazingly rare gem. wow Kan, wow. pours dark brown with creamy swirling tan head. looks fantastic. the aroma is slightly oxidized, sherry, nuts, very slightly vegetal. i was expecting more from the nose. flavors of sherry, sweet raisins, chewy caramel, and some chocolate. what amazed me about this beer was not the notes in the aroma or flavor but how smooth and easy drinking this was while maintaing a full mouth feel and intense profile. i couldn’t take any alcohol at all, not even a warming alcohol. extremely smooth. I just kept thinking how every barleywine should be like this in a perfect world as it really is the best executed barleywine i’ve ever had. this really lived up to the hope and hype I had for it. Awesome! Big thanks Kan!"
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 81)",4.3,"bottle thanks to the man who shall not be named. huge huge huge thanks to that man.... pours a dark brown with a thin light tan head that diminished to a wispy resemblance of its former self.... nose was of rich dark fruit, caramel malt.  not too amazing but it does hold its own..... flavor def. takes a turn for better. incredibly smooth on the dark fruit and sweet front.  it’s caramely and sugary but never becomes cloyingly so.  creamy smooth mouthfeel and you can’t notice the abv at all.....oh and this is my 500th rating and a well deserved one at that."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 82)",4.3,"Pours dark brown and nearly opaque, with traces of ruby in the hips of the tulip glass.
A tan head of humble proportions struggled to reveal itself, with a stretch of a pour.
The quarter-inch of foam dissapated quickly, leaving a partial coverage at best.
Susequent swirls of the glass rose up continued frothing easily.
Remarkable in the nose. Heavily laced with thick malt, dried figs, charred oak, bourbon, and port. 
Layers of richness continue with shades of leather, sherry, dark rum, toffee, and vanilla.
Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Quite sticky and somewhat syrupy.
The pallet is rich and decadent. 
Caramelized sugars, chewy malt, vineous port, and burnt chocolate bits.
Beneath the massive malt bill and unfermentables lies a cherry-like oxidation and bourbon.
Bitterness and any hopping is negligable, and the vineous nature leans the brew into an ""Old ale"" stance.
Finishes sweetish with lingering dark rum, port, smoked leather, and caramlized brown sugar.

A totally unique beer, with liquer overtones."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 83)",4.4,"Bottle for rating #2400: Viscous pour, burnt caramel in color, the deepest brown before becoming black, thin short lived light beige head, a few whisps of lacing. &nbsp Being at nearly two and a half years in the bottle, it has taken on an aged appearance. &nbsp The aroma is dominated by the raisin and prune. &nbsp Very subtle oak, vanilla, and bourbon character as well. &nbsp I can see where the aformentioned aromas might have been stronger years ago. &nbsp Any sort of hop presense has diminished. &nbsp Oh my lord, on first sip you realize how smooth and silky this one is. &nbsp WOW! &nbsp Amazingly smooth. &nbsp Wrapped around my tongue are raisins, prunes, soft caramel, and sense of accomplishment. &nbsp This is one of the better Barley Wines I have had in a long time. &nbsp Damn! &nbsp This one takes on a Port like quality. &nbsp Utterly delicious! &nbsp I do believe this one needs to be brewed again. &nbsp Full bodied, silky smooth mouthfeel. &nbsp So clean, well balanced, and flavorful. &nbsp This one is very warming, but not alcholic at all. &nbsp I am amazed to see that it is listed as 11.6% ABV. &nbsp Quite sweet on the tongue, but not yet cloying. &nbsp I think as time goes on it may get that way though. &nbsp Lingering raisins and prunes, with faint hints of vanilla, oak, and bourbon. &nbsp Sad to see the remainder of my glass being finished. &nbsp I really wish I had more of this. &nbsp Fantastic stuff!"

Midnight Sun M,"(1, 85)",4.5,"Thanks Jeff.  Pours to a dark brown body with ruby highlights.  A thin brown head.  The aroma is really nice.  Aged malt and barley with notes of sherry, port, and molasses.  Sweet vanilla.  The flavor is sweet aged barley, sherry, vanilla, oak, and port wine.  Toffee.

Midnight Sun M,"(1, 89)",4.4,"#1700.  22 oz bottle had at Midnight Sun tasting.  Deep dark brown in color with a little  off white head. Chocolate, roasty caramel bourbon aroma. Roasty, caramel and woody vanilla flavor. Dark fruity notes. Plums, figs, and raisins. Bourbon was not overpowering. Very smooth and drinkable.  Chocolaty finish. Complex beer. Smooth and creamy. Alcohol very well hidden. Very enjoyable. Wow. Well balanced."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 90)",4.5,"Here it is, ratebeer rating # 3,000 (finally, I am someone!!!). 22oz bottle acquired in trade with DarkElf (thanks!). Poured a dark mahogany color with a smaller sized tan head. Aromas of dark fruits, chocolate, caramel, light roast, smoke, brown sugar, bourbon (not overpowering) and wood. The woodiness came out more and more in the aroma as the beer aired out. Aromas were very complex and I kept getting more as I smelled each time. Tastes of dark fruits (raisins and plums), caramel, earthy / peaty, woody, candi & brown sugar, and vanilla. Very sweet, not cloying, but any sweeter and it would be. Alcohol completely hidden. Creamy body. The barrel aging was done very well; it complimented both the aromas and tastes nicely."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 91)",4.2,"Thanks to hopdog for sharing and congrats on 3,000!  Bottle 05-05-05.  Pours a deep/dark brown with ruby red highlights when held to the light.  Head was average size with a dark creamy tan head with small bubbles and lots of darker tan lacing.  Aroma was very strong, dark fruits, lots of vanilla, woody, earthy, bourbon, hints of alcohol and nuts.  Flavor is very sweet, almost sticky, lots of roastiness, vanilla, various nuts, roasted almonds, caramel, hints of bourbon. A lot of the flavor comes out in the after taste.  Alcohol well hidden in the flavor but still just a little on the sweet side even after sitting for close to 2 years."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 92)",4.6,"From a 22oz Bottle.  Deep, roasty brown colors with some ruddy cherry hues and a thin layer of desperatly clinging, creamy beige head.  Distinctly Belgian malt character in the nose - a plethora of raisins, molasses, fleshy prunes, and a hint of cinnimon spice.  Some notes of caramel and vanilla toffee are also present in the bouquet, adding a  thick dessert-like quality to the spicy belgian malt concoction that rests beneath the nose.  Fantastic full-bodied mouthfeel with a shimmering carbonation that lightens up the weight of the palate, making it full bodied without getting syrupy.  Easily one of the best mouthfeels I have ever experienced.  Lots of deep caramelly raisin characters with loads of prune and molasses-soaked organic brown sugar.  Some sticky fired cured Virginia tobacco gives it a unique woody character.  So many wonderful things are going on here its difficult to describe with words, but there really is no need as this one is a truly memorable experience.  A well caramelized british raisin pudding topped with a slice of port soaked dried pineapple.  Warming finish, but without any harsh edges.  Fantastic blend of British and Belgian styles - if there were a conceptual beer to perfectly suit my tastes, this would be it, and this one proves that this concept was an excellent idea.  Thanks for sharing, Chris!"
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 93)",4,"Courtesy of Pailhead. Dark brown mahogany with light beige head. Super sweet aroma. Full of caramel, mollasses, toffee, butter like bourbon character. Flavor much the same, huge sweet malt through and through, with even bigger bourbon kick through the middle and finish. Warming affect in finish. Great mouthfeel considering the huge malt bill, would expect more syrup like body. Well done, wold score even higher without the huge bourbon and alcohol kick towrds the finish."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 94)",3.9,"Gently lacing fading beige head covers the dark brown body. Exquisitely toasted maltiness reaches the nose and penetrated the mind with maple richness and pancakes succulence. Rich, but not too aggressive. It is immensely sweet, but kinda fitting. The bourbon oakiness mostly appears in mouth, otherwise the beer is an opus to malt. Considerable grape character evolves on the palate toward blackberries, while vanilla laden minty flavours corroborate the initial brown chocolate sweet barrel aspirations. Grenadine syrup eventually joins the race to caramilk land. Building layers of fun to decorticate malt elements that ensures its legend to stay well alive among beer geeks. Thick bodied, low carbonation, decadent, if not quite my style."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 95)",4.8,"That’s quite a story on the bottle.  Generously shared by Blankboy with Hogtown Harry and myself.  Pitch black, small tight beige head, looks fantastic.  Slightly sour, roast aroma - an interesting combo that works - tons of roast, malt, and chocolate.  Wow, what a silky mouthfeel - this is as good as a beer can ""feel"" in your mouth.  Where to start with flavour?  Sour tart fruit, tons of chocolate, icing sugar, leather, oil, alcohol, vanilla, and lots of bourbon that never dominates.  One of the most stunning beers I have ever had.  So balanced, alcohol kept in check.  Complex!  Drinkable! Thanks for sharing Paul!"
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 96)",4.3,"Poured a very dark clear ruby color with a small light tan head.  Tan legs.  Mlaty aroma of sweet dark fruit, raisins and woody.  Like a red wine.  Moderately sweet malty flavor with more dark fruits.  Light bitter finish with tannin notes.  Semi-dry.  Full bodied.  Yummy and goes down nicely."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 97)",4.3,"Bottle shared with HogTownHarry & tupalev -- courtesy of biz82. Pours a dark ruby-brown with an average size diminishing creamy off-white head. Nice aroma of caramel malt, chocolate, dark fruit, molasses, bourbon, vanilla, mild hops and so much more, man there’s a lot going on here! The flavour is even better then the aroma and it friggin’ blew me away! Bourbon, chocolate, dark malt, dark fruit, hops, vanilla and on and on -- WOW -- there’s just so much going on and it’s so complex. Not much sign of that 11.6% alcohol. Medium to full bodied, syrupy mouthfeel. This is simply a spectacular Barley Wine and I’m thrilled that I got to try it, thanks to biz82."
Midnight Sun M,"(1, 98)",4.5,"<b>Bottle (650ml)</b>.  <i>Shared with blankboy and tupalev, blankboy’s bottle</i>.  Looks like an impy stout - opaque brown-black with a good-sized light brown foamy-creamy lasting head.

Taste ... holy Jesus;  sour cherry, molasses, alcohol, bourbon, hops, yeast, leather, other fruits, french vanilla ice cream - smooth, balanced, aggressive, in-your-face and sophisticated;  unlike anything I’ve ever had.  Mouthfeel thick, roasty, alcoholic, acidic, syrupy, thick - amazing ... more of an over-amped impy stout with more fruit - long finish, lovely aftertaste.  THANK YOU to blankboy for sharing."

Aroma of prune, caramel, and toast, with chocolate and a heavy dose of toffee.  Sweet toffee and breads dominate the flavor in addition to caramel and red grape.  Tannic.  A touch of bitterness around the edges.  Good complexity, but a little sweet, reminding me a bit of Pannepot.  Medium-full bodied, heavy.  Long, sweet finish."
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 1)",4.8,"Dark dark brown color with swirls of cream laced across the top of the beer. Aroma is beautifully rich and malty, chocolate and fruit, candy and alcohol. The body is spectacular, smooth, sticky and coating.  This is just an exciting beer."
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 2)",4.1,"Bottle provided via trade from Walt (THANKS!) and served in my Duval snifter: Pours a deep chocolate brown with a fading tan head but outstanding oily legs. The aroma of marzipan, old rye bread, brown sugar, molasses, fig, vanilla bean, walnut, port-like vinous esters, non-aromatic English pipe tobacco and one big musty cellar. The taste is pure dark sugar at first with a heavy handed over ripened fruit complement. Some undertones of white pepper, clove, star anise, bourbon, vanilla, and french oak awakens the palate. A very rich layer of caramel and rye constantly cover the tongue. The finish is a liquorice and anise smack down with a little help of vinous luxurious snap. The mouth feel is oily and heavy through out but there is enough warmth and spice bite to keep it from becoming overblown and cloy.  Unique for sure, a hybrid of Belguim Strong and Stout mixed with a barley wine base. YUMMY!"
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 3)",3.2,"(Bottle 65 cl) Dark brown with a reddish glow and a creamy, off-white head. Sweetish aroma with lots of dried fruits. Very full-bodied, lots of roasted malt, lots of dried fruit and some vinous, port-like accents. Extremely - almost cloyingly - sweet, making this hard to drink. Tasted at the Oklahoma Beer tasting March 06 hosted by mjames and lilannie. 240306"
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 4)",4,"Dark/tan and orange body.  Maple syrup is strong in the nose with soy and rum.  Sharp syrup think mouth.  Flavour is complex with sweet maple, plum, brown sugar and dried fruits.  Strong cola flavour.  This beer sits on the fence between imperial stout and barelywine.  Very sweet, most likely what sam adams triple bock wanted to be."
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 5)",4.4,"A superb beer! Dark garnet showing amber at the edges. Maple, figs, fusel alcohol. A touch of soy? Fruitcake. Rather sweet. This is what SATB wants to be. Yogurty sour milk in the nose, part of an acrid profile that reminds of baltic porters."
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 6)",3.9,"22 oz bottle, sampled 30 JAN 2006 (release date – 05/05/05): mostly diminishing head that leaves a very thin, wispy taupe head.  Sweet, brown sugar aroma with malted, cherry raisins, blueberries, and soft woody smoke.  Slight wine grape flavour and sweetness hits the tip of the tongue.  Extremely dark mahogany with deep ruby highlights.  Velvety smooth texture with mushy berries rounding out the palate.  As it warms, the alcohol deepens and a lactic bitterness ensues."
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 7)",4,"RBSG 2005.

Head is mostly diminishing.
Body is dark brown.

Aroma is moderately malty (caramel, chocolate), with notes of plum, vanilla, candy sugar, wood.

Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium to full body, velvety texture, soft carbonation.

Quite liked this one, though I didn’t expect to (wow, no pungent aromatic hops?  yay!).  Definitely want to have this again, but looks like that’s gonna be tough to do."
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 8)",4.4,"Devil’s night at Mullman’s.  Sampled originally on the front steps of the convention center in Denver with EDA.  Never rated it though.  First off- this is a great new style- belgian barleywine.  It is pretty much unlike any other beer I have had, yet has all the great characteristics of a great american BW, impy stout, and belgian strong ale.  Pours a very very dark brown almost black with amber highlihgts, and a thin creamy head.  Aroms is lightly spicy, but dominated by lots of dark and caramel malts, with lots of oak, wood, and vanilla.  Flavor is nutty, sweet, lots of chocolate, dark caramel, plums raisin, figs, and a bit of alcohol has it warms.  Very smooth overall and a great long lasting finish."
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 9)",4.2,dark brown/chestnut color.  light tan head.  vinuous bourbon aroma.  flavor is smoky sweet malt.  carmelized candi sugar flavor too - brown sugar?  sweet sherry in the finish.  this is my kind of barley wine!  big thanks to DarkElf for this crackin’ brew!
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 10)",4.2,"Devil’s Night At Mullman’s. Big thanks to Mullman for sharing this gem. Dark brown color with a small tan head. Aroma is really something. Mild bourbon,
sweet malt, molasses, and oak. Flavor of dark fruits, caramel malt, bourbon with a strange, but good tart finish. 
Very nice beer!"
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 11)",4.2,"Bottle:  Courtesy of DarkElf via trade.  Excellent aroma.  Lots of malt.  Caramel, toffee, banana bread, and light bourbon.  Pours a very dark brown with slight red hilights when held to the light.  Insignificant off-white head.  Lots of caramel, toffee, and maple syrup up front.  Moderatge bourbon with hints of roasted malt, chocolate, and light bitterness in the finish.  I don’t get much burn as I would expect from such a big beer.  Big mouthfeel.  Thick and syrupy."
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 12)",4.2,"Shared at Mullman’s Devil’s Nite Bash. Wow is right! Smelled and looked like an Impy stout. Lots of body to this dark monster. Good head. Full of fizzy bubbles that helped to carry the complex flavors around the palate. Tons of Licorice in the after taste, very nice. There was some flowery-barley wine after taste, other wise, I would have called it a stout. Very nice, try nice! Thanks to Mullman!"
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 13)",4.5,"WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Poursa deep brown hue with a small tan head.  Aromas of raisins, prunes, oak,..... Alcohol isn’t noticable in the flavor.....Chocolate overtones, dark fruit and a nice roastiness......Thank YOU DARK ELF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 14)",4.9,"The aroma had a slight alcohol ester with dark fruit, plums, raisins, roast, malts, and a slight oakiness.  The beer poured a deep brown color w/ red hues; almost no head and slight lacing.  The flavor had apples, plums, raisins, dark fruit, and oak.  The mouthfeel was creamy and well-rounded w/ a full bodied.  This beer was absolutely fantastic.... Thanks Darkelf!"
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 15)",4.4,"First, a HUGE thanks to biz82 for sending this my way! Pours an opaque dark brown, about the color of a cola, with a thinned lazy tan head. The head fades out around the edge of the glass and becomes small bubbles. Aroma is VERY nice! Lots of raisins, molasses, maple syrup, brown sugar, bourbon, wood, light vanilla, and alcohol soaked fruits. Very much like Sam Adams Triple Bock. Oh. My. God. This is absolutely delicious! Lots of brown sugar, dark chocolate, raisins, molasses, bourbon soaked wood notes, rum soaked fruits, vanilla, and light tobacco notes. Indeed very port-like and sweet. Body is not quite as syrupy as expected. There’s a mild carbonation feel to it. Some obvious alcohol warmth. Creamy at times as well. Very nice. Finishes with lots of raisins, light figs, bourbon and wood, molasses, vanilla, rum cake, chocolate brownies, and brown sugar. Very rich and very good! I wish I had an extra to age...."
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 16)",4.2,"Thanks to DarkElf for this bottle. Dark brown, with a small, tan head. Aromas are oak, bourbon, sweet malt, dark fruit, and brown sugar. Heavy, thick  body, with sweet malt, brown sugar, bourbon, dark fruit, and oak.  An excellent brew, I need more of this."
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 17)",4.5,"Very dark brown body is topped by a very fine-textured, creamy head. The aroma is rich. A bourbon barrel aspect is present, but it’s far from overbearing or dominating. Instead it meshes seamlessly into the pears, honey, brownies, bananas and a touch of floral perfume. The flavor is definitely sweet, but keeps from quite edging into cloying. The bitterness is balanced, so this obviously isn’t in the Sierra Nevada Bigfoot strain of barleywines. The rich maltiness, in addition to what was in the flavor, is a bit like maple syrup and pancakes. Hefty and satisfying. The liquid is very viscous and the carbonation provides an extremely creamy mouthfeel. Thanks to biz82 for the opportunity to try this one."
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 18)",4.3,"Down in the depths of my fiery home, the beer shines a burnt mohagany.  The summons bell wll chime, tempting you and all the earth, with absolutely no head.

Midnight Sun M,"(2, 19)",4.3,"22 oz. bomber, shared by DarkElf, you rock dude!  Pours dark brown, opaque with a thick tannish head which left good lacing.  Aroma is sweet and rich with dark roasted malts, brown sugar, caramel, wood and whiskey notes (both from the bourbon barrel and the alcohol content)  Flavor is rich , dark fruits, brown sugar and molasses, smooth alcohol, dark coffee, port wine notes, wood, earth and dried ripe cherries.  What an amazing amalgam of sensory stimulation!  Smooth mouthfeel, gentle carbonation and very drinkable - dangerously so for an 11.6 abv monster.  This is one rockin’ brew!"
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 20)",4,"Rating #1000.  Bottle.  Deep brown - near black - in colour with a thin tan coloured head.  The aroma was candyish, some yeast, lots of brown sugar, quite sweet with some roasted malts.  The flavour was quite sweet as well, lots of brown sugar again, candied fruits, dark cherries, chocolate malt and caramel.  Some minor alcohol present, thick mouthfeel, medium body, medium carbonation.  Finishes with a lingering light bitterness, slightly dry.  Midnight Sun’s 1000th batch and my 1000th rating, what could be better then that?"
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 21)",3.2,"Pours with a dark brown body topped by a thick head with a good amount of lacing.  It’s sweet and full of candy sugar notes, malt and a touch of fruit.  Full bodied, smooth and a touch dry."
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 22)",4,Very dark brown with a red hue and a creamy thin walnut colored head. Sweet brown sugar and dark caramel with some leather and a hint of alcohol. Very sweet but balanced by the complex nutty malt musky bourbon flavors and a lick of tartness. Luxurious body. I think the commercial description is right on and the beer lives up to it. I hauled six bottles 20 miles into the Alaskan bush on a canoe trip which were greatly appreciated by the locals I was with. The evening’s conversation tended to alternate between bear encounters and how this was unlike any beer we had drank.
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 23)",3.9,"Deep brown in color, chestnut, with a tan head. Full on malty, with plenty of brown sugar, some light smoke, and a good dose of maple. Medium to full body, alcohol is present, but only slightly. A damn fine beer."
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 24)",4.3,"Thanks to mjames to sharing this. I struggled on whether to even rate this, as I never did quite get a handle on it. I do know that the aroma was like a good scotch, and that went further into the flavor, with hints of a good pipe tobacco. Very smooth for 11.6%, had so much going on in the flavor that I couldn’t ever really wrap my palate around much. There was a strange flavor that I can’t begin to describe, that while not awful, kept this from being perfect. Close to being the most complex thing I have ever tasted."
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 25)",3.5,"Bottle sampled @ RBSG 05’ (Montréal) Grand TastingDark burgundy color, nice head, lots of lacing. The nose is strong with smoke, salt and brown sugar, lots of strong odd flavors. The finish is strong, musky and sharp. Some yeast and alcohol is present from the copious use of candi sugar but still remains above water."
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 26)",4,"Aroma of dark chocolate, mulberries, firewood-sweet but not cloying. Soft mouthfeel. Raisins, a pecan or 2. Very dry finish. Another extremely well-crafted overly sweet barleywine. What pushed this past ""just good"" was the softness of the alcohol and the incredibly benign addition of bourbon-barrel aging"
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 27)",3.8,"Rerate (Aug-06, 8-3-8-4-17=4.0): Blackberries, vanilla, oak, bourbon, chocolate, nutty marzipan and alcohol all blend well in the nose.  Opaque brown body is topped by a low tan head that recedes to a lasting cover.  Sweetness is offset by alcohol.  Chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and berries all make guest appearances.  Medium full body is liquorous and warming with low carbonation.  Bottle enjoyed with beerbuzzmontreal, MartinT, Olivier_MTL, Rastacouere and Yowie.  Original rating (7/20/05, 7-3-8-3-15=3.6): Thick, sweet, vinous dark fruits with roasty malts and soy.  Opaque brown-black with low tan head that recedes to ring with some lace.  Sweet dark chocolate with maple and vanilla notes that lead through to roasty dark malts and alcohol in the finish.  Medium-light body with fair carbonation.  Bottle sampled at RBSG’05."

M has a dark brown body that supports a small off white head.
Caramel and molasses come through in the aroma. 
The flavor is off balance somewhat, being a bit too sweet. Cloying."
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 29)",4.2,"Blackened ruby. Attractive gray-tan foam disperses to form a tightly packed fringe. Lace dots the glass. Splendid nose of port, tobacco, mashed prunes, and fruitcake. Touch of wood and salty bourbon. Lush, pillow soft carbonation. Superbly conditioned. Mild dried plum tartness caresses the jet-puffed thickset malt structure. Tardy, but sufficient, emergence of tannins and dainty yeast fruitiness pierce the viscid consistency. Magically, the alcohol is never a factor, even as it reaches room temp. Artfully placed crystallized sugar grittiness reinforces the fluffy malt backbone. Gains more jammy succulence as it breathes. Next-to-nil phenolics fail to complement the sweetness, but the redeeming aridness more than compensates. Finishes juicy with a kiss of fruitcake infused with grapey acidity as a powdery brush of oaky dryness skims the palate and stabilizes the sweetness. Hops seal the finish by lending a lasting breath of fruitiness. Feels downright wonderful on the mouth, aroma and flavors are quite cohesive, alcohol is virtually imperceptible, and the bourbon shows plenty enough restraint to allow the complex nuances to come forward. What a way to commemorate ten years!"
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 30)",4.1,"Excellent aroma of dark fruits, toffee, malt and alcohol. Excellent flavor of dark fruits, molasses, toffee and alcohol. The body is light to medium with a slick, liquorous texture and soft carbonation. Wow.

Midnight Sun M,"(2, 35)",4.2,"Bottle aged about a year: Pours a nearly opaque dark brown with a thin, wispy tan head.  Aroma of sweet complex dark caramel malts and lots of raisins.  Body starts with a full, sweet, complex viscous maltiness. Nicely balanced, with good aged complexity.  A very nice barleywine.  I sure wish this was easier to find.

Sampled at the RBSG ‘05 bottle tasting courtesy of mjames: Very viscous, nearly opaque dark brown pour with a thin tan head.  Rich, sweet, caramely and dark chocolatey with some candy-like sugar throughout the aroma.  Body is filled with chocolate chip cookie dough sweetness with good sticky maltiness and a hint of bready Belgian yeast.  This reminds me a lot of Pannepot and should age gracefully.  Another great Midnight Sun beer."

Overall:  a very well balanced barleywine--yummy!"
Midnight Sun M,"(2, 41)",4.2,"Body is deep brown, very close to pitch black but also with some walnut color near the top.  The head is regular sized with brown sugar colored bubbles.  First scent of the nose is vanilla beans, brown sugar, perhaps some strange (can’t put a finger on it) meaty/soy sauce/worcestershire sauce.  Sweet bourbon dates, definitely a strong raisin presence, and a chemical-alcohol tinge of black, thick (dare I say triple bock?) steak marinade.  10 minutes later when this sucker has warmed the bourbon just opens up so well... resiny, sour, woody and everything else.  Really wonderful aroma developed at a warmer temperature for this one.  The oak is bolder as well, with that definitive oak wood scent that you can smell through the bourbon, much like you can smell through any other fluid that may have sat in an oak barrel before it being used for brewing.  First up front on the lips it’s tingly and sweet, the Belgian yeast is noted easily, and there’s a pleasant buzz or numbing on the tongue from the bourbon and slightly peppy bite of wood. Seems the bourbon and wood are light flavors overall, which is really appreciated.  The finish is magnificent... deep, roasty raisins, plums, some chocolate and a strong molasses presence.  Ultimately a bit thinner than expected, but when you’re comparing something that uses candi sugar to up the gravity without weighting down the palate to American style barley wines, that should be expected.  The port resemblance is there... seems like a definite winter warmer drink, though it was released in May.  I can see how some people might not like this one, there’s a lot of activity... it takes some getting used to.  The bourbon compliments the maple and brown sugar flavors well, and the soy sauce likeness is just below a level at which it would being to annoy.  For what seems like a kitchen-sink brew, it’s quite tasty, and certainly unique. UPDATE:  A day later I realized that it had a flavor that was similar to NyQuil, that hars"

Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 43)",4.4,"Pours a deep dark pinkish ruby colour. Aroma is bursting with berries, a cherry, raspberry, blackberry mix with a light hint of vanilla, a small ‘jenka’ Chewing gum sensation, and light honey. The boysenberry sure smells incredible. The taste is intense with the thickest fruit imaginable, notes from the aroma translate into the taste. Fat mouthfeel, intense finish and an aftertaste with enormous duration. This stuff is impossible not to like. Maybe not the complexity of a well made beerenauslese or TBA but this is outstanding nonetheless."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 44)",4.2,"Sampled from the tap at the meadary. Pours a deep dark purple with a hint of a pink head that starts and remains at the edges.

Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 47)",4.2,Bottle thanks to torrey. Pours out red purple color. Nose is very nice berries sun screen alcohol and some sweetness. Taste is more of the berries booze and honey sweet.

Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 54)",4.4,bottle at Muckfest 2017. Ho Lee Fuk. Wowe. Literally the best mead I have ever had. Strong fruit and sweet honey. Fucken tits
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 55)",4.5,"Mead shared at homebrewcon 2017 by Ken Schramm - thanks!! Wonderful dark luscious red. Jammy blackberry nose. Decadent. Got to try two different versions, the commercial one fermented with 71B and another with RC-212, which was dryer and more tartness of the fruit showed. With 71B you can get both the fruit and the honey quite well."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 56)",4.3,"Bottle (375 ml), split 2-ways with the lady. 2nd birthday release. Deep purple-red leaving sticky legs on the glass. Aroma is intensely fruity and while I don’t eat boysenberries often it does share many similarities with rapsberries, blackberries and loganberry as the descriptions states. The honey sweet is also felt in the aroma. Taste is, like is so often the case with Schramm’s, a nearly perfect mix of fruit acidity, honey sweetness and alcohol. The blackberry-like features are dominant but I also get some red raspberries notes and bluberries as well as vanilla notes. Medium body. Still. A bit tannic. Fruity finish with lingering honey sweetness and moderate alcohol wamrth. Decadent, yet so well balanced. The first 2-3 sips were blackberry juice alike but once it breathes a bit it reaches world-class level (or Schramm’s level). Another great fruited mead!"
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 57)",4.4,"375 ml bottle shared by Mark - thanks again, Mark! Pours a deep, rich burgundy with no head. Boysenberries galore. Layers of sweet, rich, and slightly tart berry fruits, with honey, grapes, blackberries, blueberries, raspberries. Medium-full bodied, with no carbonation. Coating and sweet, rich and smooth. Absolutely delicious stuff."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 58)",4,Bottle shared thanks to Dan. Poured dark red with debris still. Aroma nice berries light alcohol. No carb med bod. Tastes light tart berries.
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 59)",4.5,"Bottle pour. Pours dark purple with a slight blood highlight. Chocolate covered raspberry, leather, dust, syrah grape. Very viscous. Clawingly sweet. Dry finish with a lasting blackberry flavor."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 60)",4.4,"375 ml bottle @ Radikal whale slaying, Thessaloniki. Thanks Anton! Dark red color with no head. Fruity aroma, tart berries, floral, honey. Moderate sweet and light acidic taste like aroma. Full silky oily body with soft carbonation."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 61)",3.5,"Sample, light berry flavor, some herbal grassy notes to the berry flavors. Thin body. Some alcohol burn, sugar candy finish."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 62)",4.3,"Bottle at the radikal whale slaying. Thnx to Anton. Pours very dark and deep red. Smell is intense fruity, bit sweet.Taste is full, silky, very, very fruity. Super intense. Silky mf. You don’t feel the booze. the fruityness isn’t complex, but the fruit is complex (bet you’ll read that scentence twice) . very nice mead !"
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 63)",4.7,The nose on this...dear lord. I want to dive into the snifter and swim around. So glad that I have more of these in the cellar; can’t wait for a vertical after 4-5 years!
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 64)",4.8,"Simply amazing. Tastes like berries in a glass. Aroma is much lighter than the taste, but both equally delicious.
No alcohol burn at all, and a great smooth mouth feel as well. 
Shared a bottle with friends after dinner and it was the perfect way to end the meal."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 65)",4.7,Madeline beings a slight tartness to the table that I simply crave now. I wish I had 10 more bottles of this.....guess I will have to wait until she turns 2.
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 66)",4.9,"Thanks Ryan! Wow, Madeline seriously gives the Heart of Darkness a run for its money. The boysenberry flavor is so interesting and enticing, aroma is intensely fruity. Flavor is like a raspberry, but with a different sort of tartness to it. Hard to describe. Huge fruit flavor, with subdued honey on the finish. Once again, very sweet but so well balanced. Love it."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 67)",4.3,"Batch 2 bottle shared by ygtbsm94 on 10/8/16, thanks Brad!
Deep, burgundy-tinged cherry liquid is bright, clear and shows good viscosity.
The nose is full of lusciously decadent fruit sugars, with strong, balancing acidity. Notes of blueberry, cherry, cranberry and vanilla all provide complexity, as it doesn’t just smell of straight boysenberry. As with their other meads, the alcohol is well-concealed and the mead is clean. Definitely rich, but the acidity easily balances it and leaves it enjoyable.
In the mouth, it’s equally well-balanced, of course sweet and decadent, but with a big, bright acidity boasting of fruit seed, tart juices and rich, concentrated sugars providing a honey-vanilla-like character. Tannin and acidity linger together on an ultra-soft, comforting palate. Little/no alcohol noted, certainly not what would be expected for its size. Impeccably clean and surprisingly drinkable."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 68)",4.3,"1st birthday batch bottle shared with a friend. Poured deep thick purple in colour, big amounts of sweet sticky boysenberries, sweet floral honey, caramel, berries, somehow the boysenberries adds just a Tiny bit of a tart feeling in there, which is getting masked by the honey, big sweet fruited aftertaste, ilove boysenberries and it turned out Great, but i prefer Black Agnes over this one"
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 69)",4.7,"1st birthday. Tall thin 375 corked bottle pours with a deep purple to deep ruby red body that tosses up thick stumpy legginess. The aroma just pulses with jammy fresh bowl of boysenberry and then getting into thin honey and booze notes. Wow! The taste delivers decedent, I’m not worthy, yumminess from front to back. To midway a wafer thin layer of fruit skin tannin tartness peaks it’s ahead above the sea of rich smooth jammy fruity and honey sweetness. This just goes and goes and doesn’t let up until you think you can’t take it anymore but you don’t want to. . . you can’t stop. Wow!"
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 70)",4,A bit acidic and not as sweet as other Schramms. Touch of oxidization but quite good. Nice fruit flavor complimented by honey
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 71)",4.2,"1st birthday. Been lucky to have this shared with me twice. Look forward to trying batch 1 down the road. dark red wine color, purplish and opaque. Nose is dry and tannic, similar to red wine again--blackberry and light raspberry are present, but much more bitter than you usually find the fruit presence to be in the meads from this maker. It makes me think a little bit more than I usually do when I drink one of these awesome products. Flavor is similar to aroma, lots of balanced fruit and tannic bitterness. Like the best red wine I have ever tasted."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 72)",4,"A most special occasion, celebrating the birth of my son, Jacob! Thanks so much to umich03jm for the trade! Pours deep purple red. Think, leaves plenty of legs on the glass. Aroma is boysenberry, sweet floral honey. Flavor is boysenberry, blackberry, a hint of cranberry like tartness. Blackberry tannins round out the finish. This would pair perfectly with a nice flavorful cheese."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 73)",4.8,From notes. This was shared at a tasting at Gus’s abode with several participants on September 10. 375 mL bottle of Madeline’s 1st birthday. This is a gem. The pour is a deep purple-red with no carbonation or head. Just very syrupy. The aroma is unbelievable. So much boysenberry. There is a sweetness about it and a little sharpness from the fruit. A light honey does round out the back end. The flavor is incredible as well. There is a big and dominating berry up front that fades a little toward the back end. The honey is sweet and a light syrup that poke in before a light booze offers itself. It’s a little drier than I’d like. The mouth feel is heavy and syrupy without any carbonation to interrupt it. There is a big berry and light honey combo on the aftertaste. It’s really delicious. Fuck me.
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 74)",4.1,"Poured a beautiful blueish purple with a pink head. Aroma was of tons of jammy Boyden berries, one of the best meads I’ve ever smelled for sure. Flavor was very berry forward, but finished a bit rough and hot. Overall, another great schramms mead."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 75)",4.2,"Yeah, its awesome. Reddish purple pink pour. Aromas of raspberry, blueberry, blackberry jam with some pollen floral notes. Slight alcohol in the aroma. Thick mouth coating stuff. Yumm."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 76)",4.8,"1st birthday. Bottle shared with koleminer20, Gus and others at the Unnamed Bottle Share. Aroma is wonderful boysenberry, honey, sweet, wonderful, jam. Appearance red purple, poured thick, wow. Taste is boysenberry, honey, sweet, syrup, so fucking good. Mouthfeel is heavy, syrup, boysenberry honey aftertaste. Overall, fuck me this is fucking good."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 77)",4.2,"Bottle generously shared by somebody at the Mongers throwdown. Pours a reddish purple color. A huge sweet oak and berry nose. Very sugary sweet, no heat, light tart berries but mostly just core juicy sugary berries. Amazing. So damn good."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 78)",4.6,"375ml bottle shared at ML Fontainas, 3ième fête de la St Jean, shared with Rlgk and _Angst_. Huge thanks to Alex for this generous offering.
De couleur pourpre, doré au verre laissant un reflet finement rouge sur les rebords.
Arôme est généreux, puissant avec un bouquet frais et organique de miel mais un rétro finement suret de baies rouges. Le tout est rondement bien mené, complexe laissant augurer des effluves mêlant fine acidité fruité et côté plus sauvage du miel.
Palais est réchauffant, fruité de baies rouge, certaine épaisseur en bouche avec un profil laissant échapper une fine acidité, petite douceur terreuse de fraise, framboise, acidité de mûre et autres baies au nom qui m’est souvent nouveau. Surprenant à tous les niveaux surtout dans la manière dont le miel se marie avec le fruité qui est ici très varié."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 79)",4,Shared bottle at Aaron’s. Big nose with booze. Fruit. Blackberry and raspberry notes. Sweet and sticky.
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 80)",4.7,"Thank you Brad! 

Deep purple body. Grandiose nose of dark berries and jam. Amazing nose and flavor. So delicious it’s difficult to focus on anything else."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 81)",4.4,"Bottle at Woodshop 10 thanks to richiesd. Inky purple pour, still, big alcohol legs. Outstanding blackberry pie and fruity berry blend aroma. Flavor is super jammy and rich, excellent interplay between sugar, acid, alcohol, and tannin creating pinot noir like complexity but with wildly intense flavor. Exquisite palate, dense and rich but not syrupy sweet. Amazing."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 82)",4.2,"Bottle thanks to Brian. Pours a dark purple with no head. The aroma is honey and berries. Thick, jammy, boysenberry, vinous, very sweet, really impressive."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 83)",4.8,Madeline is just a treat. Ruby red edges around a purple body. Smell is honey and boysenberry essence. Taste is great - a tad less sweet and more berry and earthiness than other Schramms fruit bombs. Amazing stuff. Wish I could get cases of it!
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 84)",4.3,"Bottle shared by Kermis at a mini Netherlands session. Pours vampire blood purple with no head or lace. Flavor is sour apple, boysenberries, blueberry, raspberry, and vino honey. Smell much of the same, so much dank and dark fruit. I’m loving this one."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 85)",4.4,"Bottle shared. Dark dark red with no head. Aroma is red wine like but with spice, red fruits, raspberry and honey/floral aspects. Flavour is heavy sweet. Full bodied with a thick chewy mouthfeel and soft carbonation."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 86)",4.7,"Bottle - Holy @#$%!!! I’m in love. Nose is honey, sweet, boysenberries, black currants and raspberries. Taste is very sweet and decadent with beautiful flavors of the boysenberries, blackberries, and a slight bit of lemon zest to finish."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 87)",4.5,"375 mL bottle. Pours blood red. Thick. Smell is honey and boysenberry jam. Sweet and rich fruit aroma. Taste is also very sweet. The fruit lends a deep tartness and is reminiscent of currants. Sweetness is rich and heavy, as is the mead itself. Strong alcohol bite is the only detractor."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 88)",4.2,"Bottle at Schramm’s. Pour is deep purple with some nice lacing. Aroma and flavor of raspberry, blackberry, oak, vanilla, and booze. Finish is sweet, but not overly so, with the booze heat coming through right at the end. Definitely sweet, but not as much so as some of their other offerings."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 89)",4.9,Just a phenomenal product yet again from these guys. I won’t go into great detail but one thing I recall while drinking this is that while it was sitting in my lap I could smell it like I had a fresh jar of boysenberry jam. Incredible.
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 90)",4,"Bottle pour. Dark purple pour, flat. Boysenberries, tart and sweet fruit aromas. Nice sweet and berry tart Flavors."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 91)",4.6,"Purple - nose and taste of rich honey, boysenberry, alcohol soaked vanilla and oak - med body"
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 92)",4.5,"Pour out of bottle at the Schramm’s Holiday Gala, thick dark reddish purple pour with no head, still pour, aroma brought tart berry, cherry, blackberry and slight currant into a bit of spice, cinnamon into lots of nice honey, vanilla. Taste was a nice mix of sweet berry, cherry, raspberry, blackberry are the predominant flavors, into a nice honey, vanilla, floral mix with a touch of tart berry as well, finishing slightly spicy, sweet. Another winner, per usual."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 93)",4.1,"April 29, 2017. Bottle at Schramm’s Balcony Bonanza (indoor edition). First birthday.

No butter nor popcorn. Very nice. 



 November 27, 2015. Bottle, shared by linusb, thanks! 


Deep purple with no head. Aroma is sweet black berries, hints of sweet raspberries berries, honey, alcohol, there are some disturbing nutty brown butter notes. Taste is sweet and tart berries. Finish is tart and sweet black berries, raspberries, black currants, honey. Medium to full bodied, oily, no carbonation. 

Didn’t live up to the expectation unfortunately, Taste was very good but the aroma was a bit off for me. 

7-4-8-4-16 = 39"
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 94)",4.3,"Bottle courtesy of linusb. Rating 4000 if I add my backlog to my current total. A coincident but extremely happy a Schramms mead is my 4000th rating on this great site. Pours viscous deep bluish red leaving some prominent legs on the glass while dissipating. Smell is heavy fruity with honey, black raspberries, blackberries, butterscotch, moist soil, liquorice root, leather, minerals and alcohol. Taste is sweet, sour and heavy fruity. Mouthfeel is round, oily, sticky sweet, tart, tiny boozy and medium to full bodied. Finish is sweet and sour with honey, black raspberries, fleshy sweet blackberries, black currants, leather, moist soil and alcohol. This is good. Really good. But somehow I’m still dissappointed. Tasty fruited mead but lacking in depth for a Schrammesque score. Sweet blackberry/raspberry jam with a very high acidity in the back. I’m in no way a boysenberry expert and this might just be the case of a berry that doesn’t suit me as well as raspberries, currants or cherries.

Re-rate! 1st birthday. I experience this as much rounder and balanced than the first batch I tried. The honey sweetness and berry tartness and astringency seems more balanced. Round and delicious!"
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 95)",3.8,"Bottle at Ratebeer Kvillebäcken Winter Gathering, 151127. Deep ruby beer with no head. Honey aroma, raisins, blackberries, almonds, toffee. Honey flavor, blackberries, grapes, almond notes, toffee, raspberry notes, sourish notes. Maybe my expectations were too high, but this was a bit of a disappointment."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 96)",4.4,"Update with ""First birthday"". Don’t get the buttery popcorn at all. Very nice indeed!! 2015-11-27, 4p A: Deep deep red. N: Blackberry, butter, popcorn T: Blackberry, Cassis, butter O: ......wow....."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 97)",4.4,"Pours deep red aroma of earthy Berry. Flavor is rich boysenberry, rich sweet, mild tannins. Fuller in body. Rich. Great."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 98)",4.9,Smell is incredibly rich and condensed jammy boysenberry essence. Taste is the same. Thick body with a slight alcohol tinge.
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 99)",4.8,"Purple red color. Juicy, delicious liquid heaven. The boysenberry flavor is bright, sweet, concentrated. Just a slight hint of tannins. Not overly decadent. Just overly amazing."
Schramm's Madeline,"(1, 100)",4.8,"Sample at Schramm’s on 8/9/15. Dark purple pour with no head and some legs. Aroma of boysenberry, light botanicals, alcohol and honey. Sweet berry flavor with some honey accents before a tart berry finish.

Tried it again at Schramm's on 9/9/18 and it's a 10 on flavor, not an 8. I usually don't re-rate, but this one is amazing."
Schramm's Madeline,"(2, 1)",4.4,"Really nice color, almost purple. Tastes like sweet boysenberries. Like all of their stuff, super juicy. Coats the mouth. Just a delightful beverage. Fantastic tribute."
Schramm's Madeline,"(2, 2)",4.8,"Dry fruity nose, very enjoyable. Taste is the same and a perfect balance between the two."
Schramm's Madeline,"(2, 3)",4.6,"This is a fantastic boysenberry mead. Very sweet. Lovely hazy dark red color. smell is slightly acidic. I love large boysenberries and this is amazing. Very earthy and herbal, yet nice and sweet."
Schramm's Madeline,"(2, 4)",5,"Omg this is so fucking fantastic..... This fruit is so
amazing... This might be the best mead I've ever had"
Schramm's Madeline,"(2, 5)",4.6,"2nd favorite beverage of the night! nice heat, bold flavors, perfect mouthfeel.

Madeline would pair nicely with my perfectly smoked signature ribs, and ANYONE BUT my mother’s cornbread...


Madeline is a wonderful mead, and an even better baby girl!"
Schramm's Madeline,"(2, 6)",4.5,Pour at schramm. Fantastic purple color. Big red wine aroma and fresh berry. Taste is big bold juicy berry. The honey is not over bearing.
Schramm's Madeline,"(2, 7)",4.4,"Pour to plastic taster at Schramm’s. Looks good; a still, cloudy black raspberry. Smells fantastic! A decadent blend of berries and honey. Tastes like it smells with a smooth, slightly tart medium full-bodied mouthfeel that’s a bit warming. Incredible."
Schramm's Madeline,"(2, 8)",4.3,Tap at Schramm’s. Aroma is ultra rich berries with lots of vanilla and honey too. Tastes very rich with a strong sweetness but never cloying. It’s basically liquid boysenberry syrup with hints of flowers and honey. So easy to drink with the perfect mouthfeel I always expect from Schramm’s.
Schramm's Madeline,"(2, 9)",4.4,Pour at the meadery. A very dark barely tinted dark red color with only a couple bubbles. A tart berry aroma. Huge jammy berry flavor upfront. Tart in the back as it goes down. An amazing honey quality flavor all throughout. Fantastic stuff as I would expect nothing less.
Schramm's Madeline,"(2, 10)",4.5,"Tap @ Schramm’s: Light indigo body; a good gradient of crimson & purple. No head, just a few stray bubbles at the top. Mind numbing berry explosion on the nose. Huge boysenberry, blackberry, & even some blueberry; juicy, sweet, nice load of honey & very mild grassiness. My saliva glands even get a hint of tartness from the aroma. Flavor is incredible. Just like biting straight into a bushel of boysenberries. Very sweet, like boysenberry syrup, yet not over the top or cloying at all. Balanced well with a hint of jammy tartness & some light perfume/floral notes in the finish. Leaves a mouth coating of honey dipped berries. The way Ken & company constantly kick out meads of this caliber is nothing short of amazing. Congrats to Alyson & James on their beautiful baby girl. What a great way to honor her - this is incredible!"
Schramm's Madeline,"(2, 11)",4.7,"Pour at the schmeadery. Pours a still, crystal red-purple. Aroma is an intoxicating blend of Berry, earth, and honey. Taste is an extraordinary balance of boysenberry and wildflower honey, with a sweet start and a fruity tart finish. Sublime."
Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"(1, 1)",4.4,"12 oz bottle bought as single. Nearly pitch black in color, opaque with slight head which is tan-brown. Aroma is both sweet and roasty with hints of coffee and chocolate. Really good. Strong malt and some alcohol taste. Definitely taste the chocolate and coffee - even more in the aftertaste. Great beer and it better be for $8.99/12 oz bottle."
Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"(1, 2)",3.8,"Mild coffee and chocolate aroma. Small head, lasts a little. Smooth but thin texture. Mildly bitter blended with typical stout flavours."

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"(1, 10)",4,".355 in Kroken while trying to enjoy Manchester United's Europa League visit to the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán stadium. While I am arguably late to the party Founders' products have increasingly become my go-to brewery over the last couple of years due to the nigh on unbeatable combination of relatively low cost and - crucially - consistently very high quality of their products. I am yet to be disappointed and would argue that Founders is among the beer-aficionado's best friends in these trying times for our world.

Having said that, the deep dark brown slightly oily, murky body of this brew is perhaps not the most inviting. The espresso-coloured head does help improve the looks along with the crocheted lacing. 

Given the alcohol level the first impressions of the aroma are perhaps lighter, less pungent and invasive than one would hope for and expect. Not that it is anything wrong with that, not at all. Regardless, the main impressions are of smoky, slightly bittersweet roasted malts with notes of wet charcoal, freshly baked brown bread and spices. The sweet component might be something akin to vanilla or similar.

The flavour is at first distinctly sweeter when compared to the aroma. Again, this is not a problem, the KBS gives you an initial bitter smack on the snout before soothing you with its sweet touch. This reviewer always enjoy beers where the combination of aroma and flavour are distinctly different but come together to produce a great experience. The dark malts are still there, but the bitterness is less prominent in the notes of cocoa, dark chocolate and coffee. The characteristics of bread and vanilla from the aroma are joined by bourbon barrels leading into a long, dry and bitter finish. One could argue that the finish is too bitter and dry for some, and I might agree at least on some level. Regardless, this combination of aroma and flavours will take you on a rollercoaster-like brewbased thrillride.

All in all the experience is helped by one of the most pleasing palates this reviewer has come across recently. Very much full-bodied, quite creamy, and slightly oily. I swear, this is (even) better than it sounds.

Given my previous Founders reviews this is perhaps getting boring, but this comes - again - very much recommended. Great stuff!"

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"(1, 12)",4.5,"Pours absolutely pitch black (I put a flashlight against the other side of the glass.  Nothing.) with a thick chocolate milk colored head that is in no hurry to go anywhere.  Aroma is chocolate croissant with roasted grain and nuts.  Mouthfeel isn’t as think as the pour would suggest, but certainly had a texture.   The first few sips blew me away.  What shot right though the middle was a vegetal, almost green bell pepper streak that I wasn’t expecting at all.  It was enveloped by what you might expect.  Subtly sweetened croissant, toasted grains and yes a touch of a bourbonish aftertaste (not the aftertaste of the beer, the aftertaste of a sip of bourbon).   Again, the vegetal taste really stands out to me in a spectacular way.  This is more savory than sweet and I wasn’t expecting it.  The aftertaste of the beer is not bitter, more toasted, and doesn’t outstay it’s welcome.  There’s absolutely some warmth in the back of the throat.  The complexity is astonishing.  I cannot believe it has taken me this long to have this. An all time great."

A local brewery had a few bottles stashed away for a while. Pours a very deep amber color. The head was thin and fizzy but to be fair it may have lost a little carbonation while it conditioned in the bottle. The aroma is very complex, it's boozy yet subtle with hints of oak, bourbon and beef jerky. The flavor is smokey but sweet. Notes of coffee, brown sugar, chocolate and a touch of vanilla.  I can only assume my bottle of KBS lost some of it's luster over time but the mild flavor only serves to enhance the complex layers of flavor.

Sweet chocolate and coffee ground developing more complexity, then bourbon wood kicks in in the aftertaste. Thoroughly souped-up version of their Breakfast Stout, staying close to it in terms of flavour profile, perhaps a little sweeter all-in-all despite the increased bitterness.

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"(1, 90)",5,"Beer #500. Goodness. Poured into a snifter. Pours black as sin with a thick, burnt marshmallow head. Vanilla, oak, bourbon, chocolate, hints of coffee and toasted sugar... What an aroma. Initial taste is heavier on the oak and bourbon up front with a hint of vanilla. Fades to mellow roasted coffee and chocolate. Body is full but not thick. Carbonation is spot on. I'm trying to find something to improve on. This is just absolutely amazing."

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"(1, 92)",3.7,"12 oz bottle received as a birthday gift from my wife.  The pour is opaque black, with a ½ inch tan khaki head.  The aroma is roast, sweet toffee malt, smoke and a big bourbon presence.  The taste is big roast, sweet toffee malt, black licorice, soy maybe and a blast of the wood and bourbon booze. The palate is heavier bodied, soft carbonation and a big boozy lingering roast sweet wood and Bourbon finish.  This beer is really well made, hits exactly what they were doing, though not my favorite style."

The taste : i immediately get smoked malt which is together with coffee dominant. than i indeed notice dark chocolate, bourbon and a hint of vanilla. The coffee, smokiness and bourbon  lasts with some bitterness. The beer is not to sweet like some stouts tend to be and i enjoy that. I like the smokiness but it outbalances  the other subtleties maybe a bit much. all by all a special beer for sure... ."

Pours opaque dark brown with small beige head. Settles as thin, transparent layer of foam unable to cover the surface of the beer. 

Aroma is very intensive, sweet with a nice boozy backbone. Sweet chocolate and caramel. Like coming into a candystore offer9ng Classic chocolates. Shoe cream, vanilla, coffee. Powerful alcohol lurking in the background. 

Low carbonation. Thick, oily and creamy texture. Have to work a bit to get it out of the glass. 

Flavor is heavy sweet. Followed by more moderate bitterness. Aftertaste is long and sweet with a spicy undercurrent. Lingers for a long sweet while.

The beer is really lively. And when i get the first draught, one massive mouthfeel fill my mouth and my stomach. This beer is a real dynamite. It has the most coffe flavor i have get from any other beer out there and i love that. The beer is so rich and complex and give you one insane mouthfeel and go down in your stomach so smouth. Your mouth is so alive when you drink this beer. You can get any detail from the flavors in your mouth.. Chocolate, caramel and one massive amount of rich coffe there. Also the carboration is moderate and in the right levels.

Hele droge sterke bitterzoete chocolade vanille bourbon nasmaak die heel lang blijft hangen. Sterker nog die droge smaak raak je bijna niet meer kwijt. Sterke bourbon geur met chocola en koffie. Dikke diepe zwarte olieachtige structuur met een kleine crèmekleurige schuimkraag. Kortom voor liefhebbers van stevige biertjes die ook van sterke drank en vanille houden anders ga je dit biertje zeker niet waarderen. You hate it or you love it.

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"(2, 41)",4.4,"2019 bottle

Black as tar with a brownish froth. I am struck immediately by the balance and complexity of the nose. Like studying a dark Rembrandt painting, I drift between the layers, the brushstrokes, the characters within the scene. No particular aroma overpowers the tableau. It goes without saying that dark chocolate and coffee are a strong presence, but too often those smells are broad and generic — KBS goes another step further. The coffee itself is fruity and nuanced, with hints of cherry and brown butter and toffee. There is a hint of vanilla bean, light licorice, some orange peel and mango. Rye bread and blackberry jam. The flavors are equally well balanced. The mouthfeel starts with an inviting, roasted bitterness of dark chocolate, progressing into a sweeter, custardy, vanill-y, crème brûlée, and finishing again with a punch of espresso. Fine carbonation throughout. Again, KBS shows restraint — while bourbon notes are present, they don't overpower. Too many imperial stouts want to boast their barrel-aged bonafides, but end up being as barbaric as a boilermaker. A rousing success."

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"(2, 51)",4.3,"Ce KBS est une relative déception. Relative car ce stout est globalement agréable avec des arômes francs et intenses. Mais déception car les arômes de café et de chocolat sont trop effacés par rapport à ceux de caramel et de bourbon omni présents. L'équilibre n'est également pas parfait, un sucre trop présent alourdit ma bouche et les arômes de bourbon un brin trop violents. Ce KBS vit encore je pense sur son image d'antan, un temps où les imperial stouts maturés en fût étaient rares. Actuellement, il existe bien mieux. Côté visuel, nous sommes sir un noir total quasiment sans mousse, classique. Le nez est intense avec un bon caractère sur le chocolat, le café, le caramel, le bourbon, le fût de chêne et la vanille. Nous n'obtenons pas la même plénitude à la dégustation avec l'alcool à 12,3% trop sur les devants, un sucre trop présent et les arômes de caramel et de fut de bourbon écrasant les autres. Excellente ampleur aromatique en seconde bouche sur un alcool chaleureux mais trop présent. Les arômes sont linéaires et se retrouvent d'ailleurs tels quels en arrière-bouche et sur le final. Excellentes longueurs et corpulences par contre et une amertume à 70 d'IBU bien dosé. Ce stout manque d'un peu de finesse."

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"(2, 70)",4.1,"Bottle from Total wine Worcester, MA.  Pours oily, somewhat milky, ink black with dark chocolate head, surprisingly big for a barrel aged beer.  Aroma, chocolate, vanilla, impression of lactose too however, lotsof bourbon, somewhat vinous, gently burnt underneath.  Very good but lacks true depth.  Taste a bit more impressive even though the barrel aging seems less obvious: rich, creamy, good roast, dense, chewable, well balanced, albeit a bit too sweet for my taste, soft, alcohol well hidden.  MF very dense and softly astringent. Very good, very tasty, lacks a bit of finesse because it's too sweet and crude, a highly acclaimed brew that consequently makes me appreciate some of my own little Belgium's brews  even more.  Sugar... makes my arteries clogged up with cholesterol, eats my teeth and messes up my beers.  I can live with heart attacks and cavities but...  Maybe I should have appreciated their regular breakfast stout more."

Aroma of mild bourbon, toffee, chocolate, soy sauce, some cocoa, some sweetened coffee, hints of vanilla. Full creamy body with a medium sweetness and a light to medium roasty bitterness along hints of alcohol. The flavor starts with bourbon, burnt chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toffee, tobacco, burnt wood, caramel and nuts. Finishes with a medium roasty bitterness, mild bourbon and light burnt notes. Pretty good - the roasted malt are pretty dominant with quiet some burnt notes while the bourbon barrel is more in a complementary role.

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"(2, 89)",3.9,"Had high expectations for this one based on the reviews. Ever so slightly disappointed. A bit one note, but that one note is good. I poured hard with this one. The result was a beautiful half head, half liquid beverage. The head looked like rich chocolate ice cream, the liquid looked like a dream cold brew coffee. Probably the best looking beer I've ever seen. Aroma is mostly bourbon with some nuttiness (probably the coffee). Taste was very much bourbon on bourbon. However, it's a bourbon with a lot of depth. Not enough coffee for my tastes. Aftertaste was more of the same but didn't hang around too long and wasn't too heavy on the tongue. Would be happy to pick this up again even though it's slightly overrated. 2019 is 12.2 ABV by the way!"

2018 bottle. Poured from bottle into my new KBS snifter. Big and dark as expected with a 1-finger brown head. 

Nose is huge coffee and with chocolate and subtle sweet undertones. 

Flavor is immense roasty dark chocolate with a big brown sugar bourbon kick and a touch of toasty coffee bitterness. 

Palate is thick, oily and super heavy. Amazingly smooth for a barrel-aged brew. Goes down easy. 

Overall, lucky getting a year-old bottle for some added smoothness but this is unbelievable. So much going on while still being delicious and drinkable. Prob my favorite BA stout!"

Beautiful sweet aroma of bourbon, molasses and coffee. Warming brings out some chocolate.  Taste demonstrates an incredible depth of flavor. Bourbon, coffee, molasses, vanilla and chocolate - but not too sweet - and a well-roasted malty bitterness to close. Aftertaste is bourbon-inflected bitter malt. Not overly boozy, but packs a wallop. Dry finish; a bit cloying. An outstanding beer. I think the sweetness to bitterness balance is amazing."
Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"(2, 100)",4.3,"Really great bourbon stout and I would put it up there among the best. Bourbon strong on the nose but not overly so.

The taste is . . . oh man! This is rich and nectar like with intense berry and blueberry fruitiness that gets into a earthy berry skin character. Right about when the berry earthy note hits the smooth thin soft sweet vanilla joins in to take this to yet another level. There’s also only echoes of sweet honey going on here well underneath the berry goodness. Delicious.

Superstition Blue Berry White,"(2, 18)",4.3,"2 oz sample from kbudd19, massive thanks for this one Kevin!



Appearance: Deep blueberry color with reddish hues and alcohol legs. 



Aroma: Massive blueberry and white chocolate presence. Lots of honey sweetness as well with a bit of alcohol and plums. 



Taste: Really sweet but not unbalanced at all with a massive amount of both blueberries and white chocolate. Rich honey. The alcohol shows up a bit, but isn’t out of place at all. 



Palate: Full body. Mouth coating sweetness. Syrupy mouthfeel. Warming finish. Lingering blueberry and white chocolate presence.



Overall: This is what should be pictured beside the definition of ""decadent"" in the dictionnary. A blueberry-white chocolate cheesecake in a bottle. It’s hard to believe this isn’t completely unbalanced... but it isn’t. Not on the level of Schramm’s The Statement Reserve or Heart of Darkness, but probably the closest contender that I have tried so far. Fantastic stuff!"

Superstition Blue Berry White,"(2, 31)",4.5,"750-mL bottle (2014). Lovely nose of blueberry, boysenberry, honeycomb, and vanilla. Clear dark purple in color. Holy crap, the taste is unreal. Dark, decadent honey with herbal blend hints with rich blueberry, heavy cream, light vanilla, and mild oak. A heavy vinous tone emerges late, syrah perhaps? Only moderate booze flavor with a sweet, dry finish. So amazing."

Superstition Blue Berry White,"(2, 35)",5,"If you look at my reviews, you will see how highly I praised the original Berry White. This one is just as good, except with blueberries instead of raspberries. I’m a huge fan of both kinds of berries, so this mead is about tied with the original Berry White to me. It is an incredible mead, although for the money, I’d rather have two bottles of Berry White than one bottle of Blueberry White. It is among the best meads (and beverages in general) that I’ve ever had."
Superstition Blue Berry White,"(2, 36)",4.6,"Huge thank you to Dakine for sharing this with me. I have very limited experience with meads and this is my first rating. Deep purple body with hints of ruby. Blueberry pie in the nose, with some chocolate and booze. Perhaps a hint of syrup. Sweet up front, followed by a gentle and delicate warmth. Teeming with berry flavors. Rich and palate coating. Absolutely delicious. What a treat."
Superstition Blue Berry White,"(2, 37)",4.8,"Deep red/purple. Oh my. The berries, white chocolate and honey are a sublime combo. Out of control. Sweeter and less tannic than regular Berry white. Simply a stunning mead."
