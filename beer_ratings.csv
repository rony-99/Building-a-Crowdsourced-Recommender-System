It has a decent head that fades rapidly. The nose is quite mild peach perfume, nothing artificial yet. First flavor seems to be mild in the wheat ale attribute, nothing really bitter but you can tell its a wheat ale fer sher. This is followed up with some peach, mind you, its there but not over the top nor in yer face. Seems to be well balanced for a peach ale, many domestic varieties come across over balanced with peach flavoring and its usually artificial in flavor. Not minding this peacy version, it's yielding a decent session. Finishes with a friendly peach tang, but never really gets tart; just simply a mild wheat ale, lacking tons of wheat ale bitterness, with just a tad of friendly peach presence. Decent carbonation throughout.",cheap,"Shiner, Texas"

21,Greene King False Nine,Greene King Brewery,2.7,"Sept 2024. Clear 500ml bottle, filtered, direct from the brewery. A 2024 special. Greene King are one of the few UK breweries (along with Shepherd Neame) to use clear glass bottles, even though they know the clear glass with have a negative impact on the flavour of the beer - the light makes the hops smell bad. They use clear glass because they feel customers like to see how clear and golden the beer looks. This ""clarity"" is a false issue, because clarity is not an indicator of quality of taste. Indeed, the best beers do not have clarity at all. Clarity is generally a sign that the beer has been well filtered, and the more a beer has been filtered the less character and flavour it has. But this is a light, easy quaffing beer that, while not having much in the way of character or flavour, is quite acceptable. There is a gentle barley malt and honey taste. And some barley sweetness which tends to mark this, as a 4% abv, to be a warm fermented beer rather than a lager or modern craft beer. Few hops (which is fine by me). All in all, not a great beer, but better than expected given the clear glass and the crude label design. I wouldn't seek it out, but I'd be happy to drink it again. It's probably a bit fragile on cask, but if fresh and well looked after would no doubt taste nicer than this filtered version. [2.7]",SilkTork,"Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk"

There are nice spicy and herbal notes, with a floral touch, going well with the hops. The yeast and Lactobacillus give some nice funky fruit notes. Nice. The taste of the beer is nice. Sweet mats and bitter hops, with a massive Lactobacillus acidity. It is sour, but definitely not too sour. There is a slight savory note too, bringing final balance. All in all, a very nicely balanced sour. The mouthfeel of the beer is also nice. Light body and a bit slick texture. The carbonation is medium-low. The acidity tingles the tongue.

En thuis langs mijn smaakpapillen laten vloeien op 21-04-2024. Chouffe alcoholvrij wordt gebrouwen bij Brasserie d’Achouffe uit Wibrin (Achouffe). De geschiedenis van La Chouffe gaat terug tot eind jaren 70. Twee schoonbroers beginnen in hun garage voor minder dan 5000 euro te brouwen en in 1982 komt hun eigen bier op de markt. Het is zo’n succes dat ze een boerderijtje kopen en volop voor het brouwavontuur gaan. Anno 2022 kan je de Chouffe-bieren drinken in meer dan 50 landen over de hele wereld. CHOUFFE ALCOHOLVRIJ is een helder goud-blond bier dat een normale hoeveelheid wit schuim produceert in een moussige vorm. Het blijft sterk aan je glaswand kleven maar zakt naderhand in elkaar tot er nog slechts een dun fijn laagje overblijft. Je ziet geen CO2 belletjes! HET AROMA: Zeer licht zurig, zoetig, beetje banaan, mout, tarwe en een beetje koriander. DE SMAAK: Zeer licht zurig, zoetig, licht bitterig, citrus, mout, tarwe en wat koriander. HET MONDGEVOEL: Medium body met een zeer kleine droge toets en een gladde textuur. Een normale koolzuur prikkeling. DE NASMAAK: Citrus, mout, tarwe, een kleine bitterige toets. De mout en tarwe tinten vloeien wat uit. HET TOTAALGEVOEL: Een harmonieus bier. HET VERDICT: Een verfrissend en moutig bier dat evenwel in je smaak moet vallen.

Aroma is somewhat sherry forward with notes of the barrels as well. Some medium light grape notes with lighter notes of stone fruit and hints of lemon. Light earthy funk with a bit of a more herbal, woody phenolic funk. Light grain and alcohol notes. Pours a slightly hazy, copper-orange color with a medium sized, moderately thick, white head that recedes quickly to the edges where it lingers. No lacing and small legs. Flavor is somewhat acidic, but not too sharp with a light grain note. Medium light bitterness and light alcohol notes. Medium light sherry notes with some oak and woodiness. Medium light grape and stone fruit notes with hints of lemon. Light earthy, horse blanket funk with more of an herbal, woody funkiness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. Overall, a solid Zenne and one of the better ones of recent. It's acidic, but not overly so. Really nice barrel and sherry notes. Fermentation characteristics come through nicely in flavor and aroma adding some nice notes that compliment the sherry well.",ineedbeer,"Beersel, Flemish Brabant"
44,Alvarado Street Coconut Rum Cake,Alvarado Street Brewery,4.4,Poured up on tap at the Alvarado Street Bistro in Carmel where it exhibits a nice dark chocolate colored body that supports a thin mocha colored head of foam. The aroma offers up inviting chocolate then rum followed by a vanilla note thinly rimmed with nuttiness. The taste delivers smooth slick dark chocolate yum nuanced by booze and a smooth candy like rum note. Plum and date like sweet fruitiness seem intertwined in the rum. midway a blend of caramel and coconut bubble to the surface rounding out the experience.

44,Central Waters Brewer's Reserve Why is the Cake Gone?,Central Waters Brewing Co.,3.4,"Aromas are cherries, dark malt, roast.

44,Humble Beginnings Out And About,Humble Beginnings Brewing Co.,3.5,"Thanks to PaleAleRider for this one for my birthday. Pours a clean, amber colour with a big frothy-creamyish warm light-beige head, good retention and thick foamy lacing left. Big caramel malt nose at first, with some cereal notes coming out to blend things, and soft hoppiness. The taste shows the caramel malt base again, but the hops are much more present, cutting the sweetness, adding some grassiness and drying the finish. Not a bad, older-school Pale Ale with the caramel malt punching things, but decent hops to balance it out. And about.",Metalchopz,"Ingleside, Ontario"

Nice fresh citrus aromas with orange juice, lemon zest, blending herbal notes and even, vinous hints eventually come out. The mouthfeel is wet, refreshing with a nice building light dryness in the finish. Good citrus flavours, mostly zest over juices. Gets hazier at last pour with hop particles hitting the bottom of the glass. A pretty good Hazy IPA that is juicy, but gets dryer and dryer as it goes.",Metalchopz,"Long Sault, Ontario"

47,Yazoo Tripping Gold,Yazoo Brewing Company,3.5,"12oz can. Has that bretty funk in the aroma letting you know that this isn't a straightforward Golden Ale.

Aroma is orange, apricot, light grapefruit. Taste is strong bready malt, citrus, hint of grapefruit. Smooth, frothy texture, lively carbonation and dry finish as taste. Strange malt dominance of flavor--perhaps age lessened hops in taste. OK.",tfontana,"Weymouth, Massachusetts"
47,Westmalle Extra,Brouwerij der Trappisten van Westmalle,4.3,"Bottle rating. Appearance of body is hazy gold with an attractive white head that seems to grow initially. Notes of banana, spice, baked bread, pepper, hay, horseblanket. Flavor exhibits sweetness with a faint tart note finishing. So flavorful for the light ABV. This is excellent.",tennisjoel,"Malle, Antwerp"

Moderate to heavy barrel aged toasted dark malt aroma. Medium to abundant body with a thick smooth texture and soft carbonation.

47,Industrial Arts Safety Glasses Pils,Industrial Arts Brewing Company,4.0,Pale hazy straw / lemon yellow with decent head. Lovely aroma of mild lemon citrus.

48,Hot Plate Countess of Flanders,Hot Plate Brewing Co,3.9,"Pours a clear golden amber from the can with dense khaki foam that dissipates slowly to leave good lacing structure, suggesting decent protein content. Aroma is elevated Belgian yeast notes, with high 4-VG phenols and low isoamyl acetate esters. The 4-VG and the foam suggest high protein wheat, lending a grape nut and medium toasted white bread pale malt. Hops are likely noble from floral farnesene and peppery caryophyllene notes, but both pale to the strong yeast character. Ethanol is elevated, offering lingering warmth and perceived sweetness, with low to moderate perceived bitterness. A dry mouth from highly attenuative Belgian yeast also helps the bitterness and alcohol linger.",jbruner,"Pittsfield, Massachusetts"
48,Louvada Witbier,Cervejaria Louvada,3.8,"Capped 500 from Total Wine in Vacaville, CA. Pours clear bright gold with a slight white head that didn't persist. Aroma of bready malt with some citrus and yeast/spice - not a strong aroma but I can parse it. Med body. Flavor is the aroma. The yeast/spice is decently strong, and I think Cardamom is in the mix. Citrus starts to suggest orange zest in a mild way.",bhensonb,"Cuiabá , Mato Grosso"
48,Mast Landing Modern Dinosaurs,Mast Landing Brewing Company,3.7,"Pours murky dark gold into a tulip. White conglomerate head with excellent retention recedes leaving scant sheets. Juicy fruit, guava and papaya aromas.

48,Bearded Iris Waffle Talk,Bearded Iris Brewing,4.1,"Pours opaque coffee with a fair buff head. Aroma produces chocolate, roast malt, vanilla, molasses and maple syrup.

48,Barrique Cukes,Barrique Brewing and Blending,3.7,"Canned 10/3/23, drunk 9/23/24. Clear, blonde-brass-golden. Medium-sized, white head quickly to cover. Moderate, almost juicy oak bursts forth from the can with a touch of spicy dill and pickle character on the very end. Excellent, sulfury minerality. The dill-like character works its way more in to the nose and I appreciate that it's the dill character and not just some salty vinegar note. Dill seems just as interesting a spice to use in a sour as any other. Doesn't feel novel or silly. Lean, well-structured malts add biscuit and seem nicely attenuated. Big oak character recedes quickly. Bright and floral with deep malts yielding big honey and white bread. Oak structure keeps it mostly balanced, alongside the acidity and spicy dill character. Rich and flavorful, pretty well balanced, though could perhaps be a shade more dry. I like their culture, though it produces light acetic which can be a bit much at times. Very unique and well-done for a challenging ingredient.",ClarkVV,"Nashville, Tennessee"
48,Lost Generation Early Dusk,Lost Generation Brewing Co.,3.6,"Pours clear amber with a white head. Aroma is caramel, roast and bread. Taste is caramel and light cashew, moving to bread and roast. Finish matches the taste.",GregMooreNH,"Washington, Washington DC"

49,Drekker Shark Punch Braaaaaaaains Double Fruit Smoothie,Drekker Brewing Company,3.5,Aromas are mainly pineapple with hints of passionfruit and salt. Flavors are similar to nose with passionfruit coming out a bit more and losing the salt. More sweet than tart with a touch bitter to balance. Full-bodied with nice carbonation. A good pineapple sweet tart beer.,drpimento,"Fargo, North Dakota"
49,Tired Hands Technicolor Splendor - Double Dry-Hopped,Tired Hands Brewing Company,4.1,"Canned 7/1, drunk 9/23/24. Moderately-to-heavily hazy, maize-gold-peach. Large, off-white head, well-retained. Not hugely aromatic. Woody simcoe? Nutty spelt? Lemon and tangerine with mild fruitiness and mild juiciness. Cracker and biscuit from the malt. Clean and free of resin/booze. In the mouth it's also not bursting with intense flavors, but a much more reserved lemon and wood character with peppery and grassy spice. Lemon moving to tangerine and light mango with lingering black pepper and nutty spelt. Lovely texture. Rich and comforting and yet very nicely-attenuated. Despite it being more subtly-flavored, it grows on you and is incredibly well-balanced with zero twang, resin or overdone wood/pine character that I too often get from Simcoe.",ClarkVV,"Ardmore, Pennsylvania"
49,pFriem Fresh Hop Hazy IPA,pFriem Family Brewers,3.9,"Can (16oz). Only slightly hazy with big white head. Aromas lemon and mango are strong. Taste is the same lemon, mango, and melon. There is a slight sweetness. Very nice and will drink again but I was surprised that visually it is not hazy. I would not call it bright or clear, but I would not call it hazy either.",jsnicholas,"Hood River, Oregon"

49,Vista Dark Skies,Vista Brewing,3.7,"Black pour, quick head. Nose is chocolate & a little smoke. Middle shows smoke, chocolate malt, coco, floral notes, herbal bitterness. Finish has a pine punch hiding. Different, but I liked it.",ttoadee,"Driftwood, Texas"
49,Coös Dooryard NEIPA,Coös Brewing Company,3.2,"Undated can from the cooler, drunk 9/23/24. Lightly hazy, copper-amber-brass. Large, white head atop, well-retained. Not a ton of aroma. Grass and light juice mix together with biscuity, crackery malts behind it. Not much brightness or comforting malt or juicy hop. Clean, from what I can tell, though. Softer mouthfeel with expansive carbonation and moderate maltiness. Good attenuation. Sharp, grassy bitterness is odd, not to-style. I get wanting to give some solid bitterness to a style that is woefully underbittered, but this isn't the way to do it. The palate does accustom to it, somewhat. Doughy, mushy malts remain adding honey and white bread. Vague fruitiness from the rather unexpressive hops. Again, it's clean, drinkable and competent, but just a bit lackluster in the hop category and the grassy bitterness isn't doing much for it, either.",ClarkVV,"Colebrook, New Hampshire"

49,E9 / Holy Mountain Sleepers in the Cave - Brouwer's 15th Anniversary,E9 Brewing Co.,4.0,"2022 review: On tap at Brouwer's Cafe, pours a clear golden with a medium white head.

Taste is also a bit unclear or nondescript, quite wheaty, dry, with sometimes a light citric-bitter aftertaste, sometimes a faint tropical sense, a d sometimes none. Very strong carbo, but rather light mouthfeel (for 6,5%). Hm, this brew is surely drinkable, but I'm not very enthusiastic.

Large, frothy, off-white head. Why does this smell so much different than the other entries? Almost a buttery edge, which I almost never get from TH. I guess it's just max fruity esters, citrus, mango and pineapple, overripe, from lots of Citra. Chewy malts. And yeah, twangy, pineapple-forward hops with hugely estery yeast. The malt is lightly nutty, mostly full of honey and biscuit. But the hops are just too bitter, moderately piney and such, leading to a bit too much twang. Very unlike the earlier entries.
